5683-32879-0010 POOR RACHEL HER NATURE RECOILED FROM DECEIT AND SHE TOLD AT ALL EVENTS AS MUCH OF THE TRUTH AS SHE DARED
5142-33396-0006 I MADE HER FOR ONLY TWENTY OARS BECAUSE I THOUGHT FEW MEN WOULD FOLLOW ME FOR I WAS YOUNG FIFTEEN YEARS OLD
5105-28241-0019 NOTHING WAS TO BE DONE BUT TO PUT ABOUT AND RETURN AND DISAPPOINTMENT TOWARD THE NORTH
5142-33396-0001 WHAT IS YOUR COUNTRY OLOF HAVE YOU ALWAYS BEEN A THRALL THE THRALL'S EYES FLASHED
5142-33396-0007 AT THE PROW I CARVED THE HEAD WITH OPEN MOUTH AND FORKED TONGUE THRUST OUT
5142-33396-0002 TWO HUNDRED WARRIORS FEASTED IN HIS HALL AND FOLLOWED HIM TO BATTLE
5142-33396-0003 THE REST OF YOU OFF A VIKING HE HAD THREE SHIPS
5142-33396-0009 THERE STAND SO I SAID AND GLARE AND HISS AT MY FOES
5105-28241-0014 ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE WAS MOST REMARKABLE
5142-33396-0005 BUT I STAYED THAT SPRING AND BUILT ME A BOAT
5142-33396-0004 THESE HE GAVE TO THREE OF MY BROTHERS
260-123440-0009 I SHALL NEVER GET TO TWENTY AT THAT RATE
260-123440-0005 AND YESTERDAY THINGS WENT ON JUST AS USUAL
260-123440-0017 THAT WILL BE A QUEER THING TO BE SURE
260-123440-0006 I WONDER IF I'VE BEEN CHANGED IN THE NIGHT
2830-3979-0001 THE CONDITION IS THAT I WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE LUTHER TALK AMERICAN STREAM LINE HIM SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE YOU WILL NEVER GET PEOPLE WHETHER IN OR OUTSIDE THE LUTHERAN CHURCH ACTUALLY TO READ LUTHER UNLESS WE MAKE HIM TALK AS HE WOULD TALK TO DAY TO AMERICANS
2830-3979-0007 MUCH LATER WHEN A FRIEND OF HIS WAS PREPARING AN ADDITION OF ALL HIS LATIN WORKS HE REMARKED TO HIS HOME CIRCLE IF I HAD MY WAY ABOUT IT THEY WOULD REPUBLISH ONLY THOSE OF MY BOOKS WHICH HAVE DOCTRINE MIGATIONS FOR INSTANCE
2830-3979-0011 THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TEACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERVE AND TO DO LOUP TOO
2830-3979-0008 IN OTHER WORDS THESE THREE MEN TOOK DOWN THE LECTURES WHICH LUTHER ADDRESSED TO HIS STUDENTS IN THE COURSE OF GALATIANS AND ROAR PREPARED THE MANUSCRIPT FOR THE PRINTER
2830-3979-0009 IT PRESENTS LIKE NO OTHER OF LUTHER'S WRITINGS THE CENTRAL THOUGHT OF CHRISTIANITY THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE SINNER FOR THE SAKE OF CHRIST'S MERITS ALONE
2830-3979-0003 THE UNDERTAKING WHICH SEEMED SO ATTRACTIVE WHEN VIEWED AS A LITERARY TASK PROVED A MOST DIFFICULT ONE AND AT TIMES BECAME OPPRESSIVE
4992-41797-0001 WELL AS I SAY IT'S AN AWFUL QUEER WORLD THEY CLAP ALL THE BURGLARS IN DOWN AND THE MURDERERS IN THE WIFE BEATERS I ALLERS THOUGHT A GENTLE REPROOF WOULD BE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT FOR A WIFE BEATER CAUSE HE PROBABLY HAS A LOT OF PROVOCATION THAT NOBODY KNOWS AND THE FIRE BUGS CAN'T THINK OF THE RIGHT NAME SOMETHING LIKECEIARIES AND THE BREAKERS OF THE PIECE AND WHAT NOT AND YET THE LAW HAS NOTHING TO SAY TO A MAN LIKE HAND LORD
4992-23283-0017 MISS WOODLEY WAS TOO LITTLE VERSED IN THE SUBJECT TO KNOW THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN NOT TO LOVE AT ALL AT LEAST NOT TO THE EXTENT OF BREAKING THROUGH ENGAGEMENTS AND ALL THE VARIOUS OBSTACLES THAT STILL MITIGATED AGAINST THEIR UNION
4992-41797-0009 HENRY LORD WITH THE DEGREE OF P H D TO HIS CREDIT HAD BEEN PROFESSOR OF ZOOLOGY AT A NEW ENGLAND COLLEGE BUT HAD RESIGNED HIS POST IN ORDER TO WRITE A SERIES OF SCIENTIFIC TEXT BOOKS
4992-23283-0020 I HAVE NEVER YET HOWEVER BEEN VANQUISHED BY THEM AND EVEN UPON THIS OCCASION MY REASON SHALL COMBAT THEM TO THE LAST AND MY REASON SHALL FAIL ME BEFORE I DO WRONG
4992-41797-0008 MISTER POPHAM EXAGGERATED NOTHING BUT ON THE CONTRARY LEFT MUCH UNSAID IN HIS NARRATIVE OF THE FAMILY AT THE HOUSE OF LORDS
4992-41797-0004 IAIN TO MAN HE EJACULATED IF YOU DON'T WORK HARD YOU CAN'T KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES DOCTOR OF LAWS
4992-41797-0007 HE GAVE UP HIS POSITION AND SHUT THE FAMILY UP IN THAT TOMB OF A HOUSE SOT HE COULD STUDY HIS BOOKS
4992-41797-0010 ALWAYS IRRITABLE COLD INDIFFERENT HE HAD GROWN RAPIDLY MORE SO AS YEARS WENT ON
4992-23283-0019 I WILL MAKE NO UNJUST USE OF WHAT I KNOW HE REPLIED WITH FIRMNESS I BELIEVE YOU MY LORD
4992-23283-0018 TO RELIEVE HER FROM BOTH HE LAID HIS HAND WITH FORCE UPON HIS HEART AND SAID DO YOU BELIEVE ME
7127-75946-0011 YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIVATE TREASURE
7127-75946-0019 YES IT IS SUPPRESSED
7127-75947-0009 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AFTERWARDS HE RETURNED TO THE THEATREER BUT IT WILL BE READILY BELIEVED THAT IT WAS ONLY A POWERFUL EFFORT OF REASON OVER HIS GREAT EXCITEMENT THAT ENABLED HIM TO GO BACK OR PERHAPS FOR LOVE IS THUS STRANGELY CONSTITUTED HE FOUND IT IMPOSSIBLE EVEN TO REMAIN MUCH LONGER SEPARATED FROM THE PRESENCE OF ONE WHO HAD BROKEN HIS HEART
7127-75946-0026 WHEN THE MUSIC BY ITS BURSTS OF MELODY CARRIED AWAY THESE ILLUSTRIOUS DANCERS WHEN THE SIMPLE UNTUTORED PANTOMIME OF THAT PERIOD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY INDIFFERENT ACTING OF THE AUGUST ACTORS HAD REACHED ITS CULMINATING POINT OF TRIUMPH THE THEATRE SHOOK WITH TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE
7127-75947-0000 EVERY ONE COULD OBSERVE HIS AGITATION AND PROSTRATION A PROSTRATION WHICH WAS INDEED THE MORE REMARKABLE SINCE PEOPLE WERE NOT ACCUSTOMED TO SEE HIM WITH HIS ARMS HANGING LISTLESSLY BY HIS SIDE HIS HEAD BEWILDERED AND HIS EYES WITH ALL THEIR BRIGHT INTELLIGENCE BE DIMMED
7127-75946-0028 BY DEGREES ALL HIS HAPPINESS ALL HIS BRILLIANCY SUBSIDED INTO REGRET AND UNEASINESS SO THAT HIS LIMBS LOST THEIR POWER HIS ARMS HUNG HEAVILY BY HIS SIDES AND HIS HEAD DROOPED AS THOUGH HE WAS STUPEFIED
7127-75946-0027 DISDAINFUL OF A SUCCESS OF WHICH MADAME SHOWED NO ACKNOWLEDGMENT HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT BOLDLY REGAINING THE MARKET PREFERENCE OF THE PRINCESS
7127-75946-0029 THE KING WHO HAD FROM THIS MOMENT BECOME IN REALITY THE PRINCIPAL DANCER IN THE QUADRILLE CAST A LOOK UPON HIS VANQUISHED RIVAL
7127-75947-0001 UPON THIS MADAME DEIGNED TO TURN HER EYES LANGUISHINGLY TOWARDS THE COMTE OBSERVING
7127-75947-0003 YES THE CHARACTER WHICH YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS ASSUMED IS IN PERFECT HARMONY WITH YOUR OWN
1995-1826-0013 SO FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME SHE WAS THINKING TO DAY AS SHE WALKED ALONE UP THE LANE BACK OF THE BARN AND THEN SLOWLY DOWN THROUGH THE BOTTOMS
1995-1826-0023 GOOBAW DON'T GROW ON THE TOPS VINE BUT ON THE GROUND ON THE WOODS LIKE YAS IS THAT SO
1995-1826-0009 YOU OUGHT TO KNOW JOHN IF I TEACH NEGROES I'LL SCARCELY SEE MUCH OF PEOPLE IN MY OWN CLASS
1995-1826-0012 SHE WANTED A GLANCE OF THE NEW BOOKS AND PERIODICALS AND TALK OF GREAT PHILANTHROPIES AND REFORMS
1995-1826-0017 THERE MIGHT BE A BIT OF POETRY HERE AND THERE BUT MOST OF THIS PLACE WAS SUCH DESPERATE PROSE
1995-1826-0020 MISS TAYLOR DID NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT COTTON BUT AT LEAST ONE MORE REMARKED SEEMED CALLED FOR
1995-1826-0016 THE GLIMMERING SEA OF DELICATE LEAVES WHISPERED AND MURMURED BEFORE HER STRETCHING AWAY TO THE NORTHWARD
1995-1826-0019 COTTON IS A WONDERFUL THING IS IT NOT BOYS SHE SAID RATHER PRIMLY
1995-1826-0024 THE GOLDEN FLEECE IT'S THE SILVER FLEECE HE HEARKENED
1995-1826-0018 HER REGARD SHIFTED TO THE GREEN STALKS AND LEAVES AGAIN AND SHE STARTED TO MOVE AWAY
4077-13751-0012 THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR LITTLEBURN W BOGGS AFTERWARD GOVERNOR WAS A PRONOUNCED MORMON HAYTER AND THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD OF THE TROUBLES HE MANIFEST HIS SYMPATHY WITH THE PERSECUTORS
4077-13751-0011 SOON THOUSANDS OF CONVERTS HAD RENTED OR PURCHASED HOMES IN MISSOURI INDEPENDENCE JACKSON COUNTY BEING THEIR CENTRE BUT FROM THE FIRST THEY WERE UNPOPULAR AMONG THE MISSOURIANS
4077-13751-0008 IT IS NOTABLE THAT THE INDIAN TRIBES HAVE GENERALLY REGARDED THEIR RELIGION OF THE LATTER SAINTS WITH FAVOR SEEING IN THE BOUC O MORMON STRIKING AGREEMENT WITH THEIR OWN TRADITIONS
4077-13751-0002 INSTEAD OF BUT SIX REGULARLY AFFILIATED MEMBERS AND AT MOST TWO SCORE OF ADHERENTS THE ORGANIZATION NUMBERS TO DAY MANY HUNDRED THOUSAND SOULS
4077-13751-0000 ON THE SIXTH OF APRIL EIGHTEEN THIRTY THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER SAINTS WAS FORMERLY ORGANIZED AND THUS TOOK ON A LEGAL EXISTENCE
4077-13751-0001 ITS ORIGIN WAS SMALL A GERM AN INSIGNIFICANT SEED HARDLY TO BE THOUGHT OF AS LIKELY TO AROUSE OPPOSITION
4077-13751-0010 TO THE FERVENT LATTER SAINT A TEMPLE IS NOT SIMPLY A CHURCH BUILDING A HOUSE FOR RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLY
4077-13751-0013 THEIR SUFFERINGS HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FITLY CHRONICLED BY HUMAN SCRIBE
4077-13751-0018 AMERICAN SCHOOLBOYS READ WITH EMOTIONS OF HORROR OF THE ALBINSES DRIVEN BEATEN AND KILLED WITH A PA LEGGATE DIRECTING THE BUTCHERY AND OF THE FAUDDOIS HUNTED AND HOUNDED LIKE BEASTS AS THE EFFECT OF A ROYAL DECREE AND THEY YET SHALL READ IN THE HISTORY OF THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF SCENES AS TERRIBLE AS THESE IN THE EXHIBITION OF INJUSTICE AND INHUMAN HATE
4077-13751-0021 IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT AN ORGANIZED MOB AIDED BY MANY OF THE CIVIL AND MILITARY OFFICERS OF MISSOURI WITH GOVERNOR BOGGS AT THEIR HEAD HAVE BEEN THE PROMINENT ACTORS IN THIS BUSINESS INCITED TOO IT APPEARS AGAINST THE MORMONS BY POLITICAL HATRED AND BY THE ADDITIONAL MOTIVES OF PLUNDER AND REVENGE
1188-133604-0023 THE CHOIST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DELICIOUS PAROQUET WAS RUBY SO THIS NASTY VIPER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SLIMY AND YET SPRINGY AND CLOSE DOWN CLOTTED LIKE A POOL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME

1188-133604-0016 THIS AT ONCE COMPELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAGINATIVE AND DECORATIVE THAT IT REPRESENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAREST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODUCING JEWELLER'S WORK RATHER THAN PICTURES
1188-133604-0024 NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRECIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACTICAL STUDY OF ART THAN THE CONVICTION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
1188-133604-0021 IT WILL BE WHOLLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR YOU TO RETAIN THE TRANQUILLITY OF TEMPER AND FELICITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NOBLE PUREST PAINTING UNLESS YOU ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN PROMOTING THE FELICITY AND PEACE OF PRACTICAL LIFE
1188-133604-0019 THE LARGE LETTER CONTAINS INDEED ENTIRELY FEEBLE AND ILL DRAWN FIGURES THAT IS MERELY CHILDISH AND FAILING WORK OF AN INFERIOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTERISTIC OF GOTHIC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
1188-133604-0018 IN ALL EARTHLY GOTHIC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FAILURE OF THIS KIND ESPECIALLY DISTORTION AND RIGIDITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECTS PAINFULLY TO BE COMPARED WITH THE SPLENDID REPOSE OF CLASSIC ART
1188-133604-0027 NOW HERE IS RAPFAEL EXACTLY BETWEEN THE TWO TREES STILL DRAWN LEAF BY LEAF WHOLLY FORMAL BUT BEAUTIFUL MIST COMING GRADUALLY INTO THE DISTANCE
1188-133604-0020 BUT OBSERVE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE CONDITION THAT OF STRIVING ALSO TO CREATE IN REALITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEEK IN IMAGINATION

4446-2273-0016 HER HAIR IS STILL LIKE FLAX AND HER BLUE EYES ARE JUST LIKE A BABY'S AND SHE HAS THE SAME THREE FRECKLES ON HER LITTLE NOSE AND TALKS ABOUT GOING BACK TO HER BANDAMIRE
4446-2273-0023 THE STRANGE WOMAN AND HER PASSIONATE SENTENCE THAT RANG OUT SO SHARPLY HAD FRIGHTENED THEM BOTH
4446-2273-0022 THEY WERE BOTH REMEMBERING WHAT THE WOMAN HAD SAID WHEN SHE TOOK THE MONEY GOD GIVE YOU A HAPPY LOVE

1284-1180-0017 AT ONE END STOOD A GREAT FIREPLACE IN WHICH A BLUE LOG WAS BLAZING WITH A BLUE FLAME AND OVER THE FIRE HUNG FOUR KETTLES IN A ROW ALL BUBBLING AND STEAMING AT A GREAT RATE
1284-1180-0021 I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAGICIAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRAINS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CATCHING MICE AND THEY PROVE OF SOME USE TO US
