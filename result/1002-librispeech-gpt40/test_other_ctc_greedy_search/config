prompt: ' You will be provided with short speech recognition sentences, and your task
  is to correct these short sentences to a standard correct recognition result without
  typos and language errors. Usually, errors are due to homophones and so on.

  To determine whether a sentence is defective, If there is no language disease, output
  the sentence or correct errors by thinking in the following way。

  （1）Locate the position of the defective phrase in the sentence （2）Give the pronunciation
  of the defective phrase （3）Give multiple candidates  according to their pronunciation
  （4）Select the appropriate candidates combined with the context

  For the corrected sentence, you need to continue to determine whether there is a
  language problem. If you do not have confidence in the correction, then give up
  the correction. You can correct the sentence up to three times

  Note:(1)Both input and output must be saved in all uppercase(2)(2)The answer is
  wrapped in [] and preceded by change#,#original# to indicate whether to change or
  not

  FOR HIMSELF INSTEAD OF TOIL AND PAIN LEAVING US LENA''S    CRICKETS ON DRY SWARD

  Inference: The sentence has language problems, correct the sentence. (1) The defective
  phrase is <Lena''s crickets>. (2) The pronunciation of <Lena''s crickets> is /ˈliːnəz
  ˈkrɪkɪts/. (3) Given the candidate phrases: <lean as crickets> - /liːn əz ˈkrɪkɪts/,
  <lend us crickets> - /lɛnd ʌs ˈkrɪkɪts/, <Lenna''s crickets> - /ˈlɛnəz ˈkrɪkɪts/.
  (4) Select <lend us crickets> according to the context, and the corrected sentence
  is still has Speech disorders, abandoning this change and repeat inference.

  Inference: The sentence has language problems, correct the sentence. (1) The defective
  phrase is <Lena''s crickets>. (2) The pronunciation of <Lena''s> is /ˈliːnəz/. (3)
  Given the candidate phrases: <lean as> - /liːn æz/, <leaned as> - /liːnd æz/, <Lenas>
  - /ˈliːnəs/. (4) Select <lean as> according to the context, as it fits better with
  the idea of being left in a lean or meager state. The corrected sentence is still
