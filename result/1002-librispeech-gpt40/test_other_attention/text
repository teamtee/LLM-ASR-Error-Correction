2414-128292-0027  TO SLEEP QUIETLY TO ENJOY THEIR NEW SECURITY
2414-128292-0014  O ART THOU HAST BECOME TOO ROUND FOR ME
2414-128292-0018  THEN ONLY DID I HIT THAT TRUTH
2414-128292-0017 SOMETIMES I MEANT TO LIE AND BEHOLD
2414-128292-0019 HOW HAVE I TOO INTO NATIONS
2414-128292-0016 THE DEVIL HIMSELF IS PERHAPS SKIN
2414-128292-0021  I HAVE ENDURED WHICH MY SAILORS SAID
2414-128292-0024  THOU ART MY SHADOW
2414-128292-0025  SAID HE AT LAST SADLY
2414-128292-0020  HAVE I STILL A GHOST
1688-142285-0000  THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
1688-142285-0011  ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO GAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0001  MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
1688-142285-0013  AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0006  I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0010  HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0007  I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0003  I REALLY LIKE THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004  HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOPBOY WAS THE THING I LIKE BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005  YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELSTONE

3528-168669-0107 THE PEAL WHICH ORDERS THE DOCTOR FOR THE DEAD TO BE SUMMONED HAS ALREADY BEEN RUNG
3528-168669-0116 EVERYTHING MUST HAVE BEEN COMPLETED A GOOD PART OF AN HOUR BEFORE THAT
3528-168669-0111  I HAVE MY HEAP OF OLD IRON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN
3528-168669-0119 MOTHER'S ATTENTION WILL BE THERE TWO MEN WOULD BE BETTER

3528-168669-0105  HAS THE DOCTOR FOR THE DEAD PAID HIS VISIT
1998-29455-0000 THE SINGING AND LAUGHING WENT ON LONG AFTER HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP AND IF LATER IN THE EVENING THERE WERE LOUD VOICE ARGUMENTS OR QUARRELS EVEN DICKIE DID NOT HEAR THEM
1998-29455-0001  WHAT'S ON THAT THERE DICKIE ASKED POINTING TO THE ODD NOBLY BUNDLES OF ALL SORTS AND SHAPES TIED ON TO THE PERAMBULATOR'S FRONT
1998-29454-0039  SO YOU SHALL SAID MISTER BEALE A REGULAR WASH ALL OVER THIS VERY NIGHT I ALWAYS LIKE A WASH MESELF
1998-29454-0041  IF YOU'RE CLEAN THEY SAY HONEST POVERTY AND IF YOU'RE DIRTY THEY SAY SERVE YOU RIGHT
1998-29454-0037 THAT WAS CHARMING BUT IT WAS PLEASANT TOO TO WATCH THE MEADOW ON THE WET GRASS

3764-168670-0029  THE CHURCH IN THE STREET THAT THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0032  ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKERS MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE COFFIN

3764-168670-0019  WHAT IS THAT EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0045  TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BALE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0046  YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANK ON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3005-163399-0006  AND I THINK HE DIED AFTERWARDS HE WAS A BAPTIST
3005-163391-0026  THEN ONE OF THEM SAYS KIND OF SOFT AND GENTLE
3005-163399-0002 I OUT WITH A YES AND BEFORE I THOUGHT
3005-163399-0007  YES IT WAS MORTIFICATION THAT WAS IT
3005-163399-0008  YOUR UNCLE'S BEEN UP TO THE TOWN EVERY DAY TO FETCH YOU
3005-163391-0024 THAT THE KING WAS CALM HE SAYS
3005-163391-0023  SO THEN THEY WAITED FOR A STEAMBOAT
3005-163399-0010 WHY CHILD IT'LL BE SO
3005-163399-0012  I HAD MY MIND ON THE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT TO ONE SIDE AND PUMP THEM A LITTLE AND FIND OUT WHO I WAS
3005-163399-0016  I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRABBED ME AND HUSTLED ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES
2414-128291-0022  AND TALKED TO MINE ANIMALS OF THE HAPPINESS OF ANIMALS
2414-128291-0016  THOU KNOWEST IT THYSELF BETTER EVEN THAN I
2414-128291-0012 IT IS NO LONGER TRUE THAT THE POOR ARE BLESSED
2414-128291-0014 WHY DOST THOU TEMPT ME
2414-128291-0009  BUT BEHOLD HIS KIND
2414-128291-0024  THOU AMIABLE ONE
2414-128291-0015  ANSWERED THE OTHER
2414-128291-0020  WELL
2414-128292-0009 WHO WHEN THEIR TRUE DISTRESS SCRUTINIZED HIM WITH HIS GLANCE HE WAS FRIGHTENED AS BY ASSERTED APPARITION SO SLENDER SWARTHY HOLLOW AND WORN OUT AND HIS FOLLOWER APPEARS
2414-128292-0006 NOW DO I HEAR OF SIX OLD FOOTLEGS RATTLING BEHIND ONE ANOTHER
1998-29455-0032 IF HE STRAIGHT HE'LL DO FOR ME AND FRIEND I'LL DO FOR HIM SEE
1998-29455-0024 BUT YOU SAID THE BED WITH THE GREEN CURTAINS URGED DICKIE
1998-29455-0036 DICKY WAS ONE OF THE QUESTIONS BUT MISTER BEL HAD NO ANSWERS FOR THEM
1998-29455-0029 CLEVER AS A TRAINED DOG HE IS IN ALL OTHERS OWN NET
1998-29455-0022  REMEMBER THAT NEITHER OF THEM KNEW ANY BETTER
1998-29455-0025 WITH THIS END NOT BY NO MEANS
1998-29455-0021  PLEASE DO NOT BE TOO SHOCKED
1998-29455-0034  WELL YOU NEVER SEE EM
2033-164914-0008 WHEN NUZAT AL ZAMAN HEARD THE FIRST IMPROVISATION SHE CALLED TO MIND HER FATHER AND HER MOTHER AND HER BROTHER AND THEIR OWN HOME THEN SHE WEPT AND CRIED TO THE EUNUCH AND SAID TO HIM WOE TO THEE
2033-164914-0006  WHAT AILS THEE THEN THAT THOU MUST NEEDS RECITE VERSES SEEING THAT WE ARE TIRED OUT WITH WALKING AND WATCHING AND ALL THE FOLK ARE ASLEEP FOR THEY REQUIRE SLEEP TO REST THEM OF THEIR FATIGUE
1998-29454-0013 AND THIS IS THE PRETTIEST PLACE EVER I'VE SEEN
1998-29454-0016 AND SAD WHEN SHE SENT A GOOD TEMPER
1998-29454-0014 I SHALL CATCH A FAIR BREEZE AS IT IS
1998-29454-0009  HERE WE ARE SAID THE MAN
1998-29454-0023 THE MAN'S MANNER WAS SO KIND AND HEARTY THE WHOLE ADVENTURE WAS SO WONDERFUL AND NEW IS IT THE COUNTRY WHERE YOU'RE GOING
1998-29454-0026 HE TOOK OUT OF HIS POCKET IN AN ENVELOPE A NEW SHEET OF PAPER AND A NEW PENCIL READY SHARPENED BY MACHINERY
1998-29454-0033 HE REGARDED THE WAKE THE LAST OF THE ENGLISH AND I WANTED WHAT IT STOOD FOR
1998-29454-0025  A BIRD PASSED IN ITS FLIGHT ON A BRANCH QUITE CLOSE AND CLUNG THERE SWAYING
1998-29454-0027 AND I ASK YOU LET ME COME ALONG HAVE YOU GOT THAT
1998-29454-0020  NO SAID DICKIE OH NO NO I NEVER
3528-168669-0030 THREE YEARS AGO MADAME DE BESSOON, A JANSENIST, TURNED ORTHODOX MERELY FROM HAVING SEEN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION AT PRAYER, AH
3528-168669-0039 AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AT ALL HOURS, PRAISED AND ADORED BE THE MOST HOLY SACRAMENT OF THE ALTAR, SAID THE PRIEST
3528-168669-0031  THE MOTHERS HAVE TAKEN HER TO THE DEAD ROOM WHICH OPENS ON THE CHURCH I KNOW
3528-168669-0036  REVEREND MOTHER I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT I SAID MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0032  A FINE SIGHT IT WOULD BE TO SEE A MAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0027  NOTHING CAN BE HEARD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GARDEN REALLY
3528-168669-0035  I SAY MORE OFTEN MORE OFTEN THAN WHAT
3528-168669-0028  AND THEN THE WIND IS NOT BLOWING IN MY DIRECTION THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0026  NO DID YOU NOT HEAR THE BELL
3528-168669-0038  AT THAT MOMENT NINE O'CLOCK STRUCK
1688-142285-0023  HOWEVER OUT IT CAME
1688-142285-0028  BUT GOOD NIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0040  I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED OF MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BOOLA AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0034  A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035  VISITING REGISTER OFFICERS SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0033  SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THEIR MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED AROUND TO WALK ALONGSIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
1688-142285-0045  BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
1688-142285-0036  ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
367-130732-0012 I SAY COME TO SAN FRANCISCO ADVISEDLY FOR WHILE THE CRAB IS FOUND ALL ALONG THE COAST IT IS PREPARED NOWHERE SO DELICIOUSLY AS IN SAN FRANCISCO
367-130732-0019 HEAT THIS IN A STEWPAN AND WHEN SIMMERING ADD THE SHERRY AND CRAB MEAT AND LET ALL COOK TOGETHER WITH A SLOW FIRE FOR EIGHT MINUTES
367-130732-0022 SO FAR IT HAS BEEN USED MOSTLY FOR GARNISHMENT OF OTHER DISHES AND IT IS ONLY RECENTLY THAT THE WHOLE BRAWL HAS BEEN MAKING A SPECIALTY OF THEM
367-130732-0011  ONE HAS TO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO TO PARTAKE OF THE KING OF SHELLFISH THE MAMMOTH PACIFIC CRAB
367-130732-0016 TAKE THE MEAT OF ONE LARGE CRAB SCRAPING OUT ALL THE FAT FROM THE SHELL
367-130732-0020  SERVE IN A CHAFING DISH WITH TOASTED CRACKERS OR THIN SLICES OF TOASTED BREAD
367-130732-0008 PUT THIS IN A DOUBLE BOILER AND LET COOK UNTIL THICK STIRRING CONSTANTLY
367-130732-0023  ALL THE BETTER CLASS RESTAURANTS HOWEVER WILL SERVE THEM IF YOU ORDER THEM
367-130732-0018 CHOP FINE THE ONION SWEET PEPPER AND TOMATO WITH THE ROSEMARY
367-130732-0017 SOAK THE CRAB MEAT IN THE SHERRY TWO HOURS BEFORE COOKING
3005-163399-0019  MISSUS PHELPS SHE JUMPS FOR HIM AND SAYS
3005-163399-0018  I SEE I WAS IN A FIX NOW
3005-163399-0026  THE OLD GENTLEMAN STARED AND SAYS
3005-163399-0017  CHILDREN DON'T YOU SAY A WORD
3080-5032-0009  MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DAMES AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND A SHARE IN HIM AND BE BELIEVED THAT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITH IT AND ALL THE KINDNESS HIS DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE
3080-5032-0007  MY BEST QUALITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERVED BUT FOR AGGRAVATIONS OF MY FAULT AND I WAS ALLOWED TO HAVE WIT AN UNDERSTANDING AND DISCRETION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
3080-5032-0011  I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUT THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDING TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0002  HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND A HUMOR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0008  TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3528-168669-0130  I WILL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3528-168669-0122  THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE NO SUSPICION
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY, IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME, STRICTLY SPEAKING, UNDER THAT HEAD. FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS, FLOWERS, HERBS, ROOTS, AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS. FROM THE LATIN WORD, CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD, MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CUISINE.
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING, WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED, IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET, UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY.
3538-142836-0010  THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0015 MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER. THEY ARE PRESERVES OF HALF-LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR.
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS, FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED.
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER. THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME.
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER, AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES, FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS.
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE, HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS, THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE.
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF MINA TO GUESS BEFORE
3331-159609-0008  THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
3331-159609-0020  IF ANNIE WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3528-168656-0002  EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR SAINT FROSOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSIBIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSIBIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANT IT IS THE DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SOON ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3528-168656-0003  AND THE SCHOOLGIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3331-159609-0024 THEN HE CAME BUSTING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0017  SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3764-168670-0011  JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RAVING
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TOMORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORESS EXPECTS YOU
3764-168670-0003  YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I SHALL COME TO FETCH YE
3764-168670-0004 EVERYTHING IS ARRANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
3764-168670-0007  IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE CHILD YOU WILL CARRY HER OUT
3764-168670-0009  FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN
3764-168670-0010  YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE IT
3764-168670-0008  AND SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I ANSWER FOR THAT
3764-168670-0002  JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HER NEAR THE FIRE
3764-168670-0006  THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFICULTY LIES
3331-159605-0007  HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0006  LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE CREDIT
3331-159605-0004  WHAT A SPITEFUL THING I AM
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE A LAST BOY AND REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WHITE LIE LEVELLY
3331-159605-0020  HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER TILL SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FAULTS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BECKY AND BESS BUT COULDN'T RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHAW'S TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FAN THAT WAS CALLING TIME
3538-163624-0017  SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNER ON A STEAK AND ROASTED IT
3538-163624-0010  SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO
367-130732-0005 IT WAS HERE THAT MOST MAGNIFICENT DINNERS WERE ARRANGED IT WAS HERE THAT EXTRAORDINARY DISHES WERE CONCOCTED BY CHEFS OF WORLDWIDE FAME IT WAS HERE THAT LOBSTER À LA NEWBURG REACHED ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION AND THIS IS THE RECIPE THAT WAS FOLLOWED WHEN IT WAS PREPARED IN THE DELMONICO
367-130732-0003 THE PACIFIC CRAYFISH HOWEVER SERVES EVERY PURPOSE AND WHILE MANY CONTEND THAT ITS MEAT IS NOT SO DELICATE IN FLAVOR AS THAT OF ITS EASTERN COUSIN THE CALIFORNIAN WILL AS STRENUOUSLY INSIST THAT IT IS BETTER BUT OF COURSE SOMETHING MUST ALWAYS BE ALLOWED FOR THE PATRIOTISM OF THE CALIFORNIAN
367-130732-0002 THIS QUESTION AND ANSWER MIGHT WELL GO INTO THE PRIMER OF INFORMATION FOR THOSE WHO COME TO SAN FRANCISCO FROM THE EAST FOR WHAT IS CALLED A LOBSTER IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT A LOBSTER AT ALL BUT A CRAYFISH
3538-163624-0023 BRUNHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNAR THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNAR SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
367-130732-0007  ONE POUND OF LOBSTER MEAT ONE TEASPOONFUL OF BUTTER ONE HALF PINT OF CREAM YOLKS OF FOUR EGGS ONE WINE GLASS OF SHERRY LOBSTER FAT
3538-163624-0024 FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRUNHILD AND GUDRUN WERE BATHING BRUNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUDRUN'S SUPERIOR
3538-163624-0020 THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING
3538-163624-0026  NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD

1998-15444-0015 NOTICE THE SMELL COLOUR AND GENERAL APPEARANCE OF THE MATTER SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION
1998-15444-0010 TICKLING THE FOXES WITH THE FEATHER MAY EXCITE VOMITING
1688-142285-0054  BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
1688-142285-0061  I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
1688-142285-0062  THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMAN
1688-142285-0055  GASP BESSY AT LAST
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED IT'S THE BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHO'S COME AT LAST AND WHO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS WHO WILL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT HE KNOWS NOT ABOUT
1688-142285-0073  PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
1688-142285-0068  I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOPED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF FATHER IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0072  MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0069  THE FEVERISH COLLAR CAME INTO HER CHEEKS AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE
3005-163399-0013 PRETTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CHILL STRIKE ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAYS
3005-163399-0014  I SEE IT WARN'T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AHEAD I'D GOT TO THROW UP MY HAND
3005-163399-0021  I CAN'T IMAGINE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES ME DREADFUL UNEASY
3005-163399-0015 SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE'S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO REST THE TRUTH
3005-163399-0025 WHY SILAS LOOK YONDER UP THE ROAD AIN'T THAT SOMEBODY COMING
3005-163399-0022  UNEASY SHE SAYS I'M READY TO GO DISTRACTED
3005-163399-0024 OH DON'T DISTRESS ME ANY MORE'N I'M ALREADY DISTRESSED
3005-163399-0020  HAS HE COME NO SAYS HER HUSBAND
3005-163399-0023 HE MUST HAVE COME AND YOU'VE MISSED HIM ALONG THE ROAD
3005-163399-0011 IT WAS KIND OF THIN ICE BUT I SAYS
3005-163391-0016  WELL THEY COULD BE WORSE OFF
3005-163391-0020  WAS PETER WILKES WELL OFF
3005-163399-0004  WHEN WE GOT THERE SHE SET ME DOWN IN A SPLIT BOTTOM CHAIR AND SET HERSELF DOWN ON A LITTLE LOW STOOL IN FRONT OF ME HOLDING BOTH OF MY HANDS AND SAYS
3005-163399-0000 PHELPS'S WAS ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONE HORSE COTTON PLANTATIONS AND THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE
3005-163391-0025 THEY GIVE A GLANCE AT ONE ANOTHER AND NODDED THEIR HEADS AS MUCH AS TO SAY WOULD THEY TELL YOU
3005-163391-0022 NOW HUSTLE BACK RIGHT OFF AND FETCH THE DUKE UP HERE AND THE NEW CARPETBAGS
3005-163399-0001 I WENT AROUND AND CLIMBED OVER THE BACK STYLE BY THE ASHOPPER AND STARTED FOR THE KITCHEN
3005-163399-0003  SO THEN SHE STARTED FOR THE HOUSE LEADING ME BY THE HAND AND THE CHILDREN TAGGING AFTER
3005-163399-0009 YOU MUST HAVE MET HIM ON THE ROAD DIDN'T YOU? OLDISH MAN WITH A
3005-163399-0005  WELL IT'S LUCKY BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO GET HURT
2609-156975-0009  THE LATER TRADITIONS TO EXTEND THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0018  NATURALLY HE WENT TO THE LAND OF MEDIAN
2609-156975-0014  THE MAKING OF A LOYAL PATRIOT
2609-156975-0020 FROM ABOUT TWO THOUSAND B.C.
2609-156975-0030 MANY MODERN SCHOLARS DRAWING THE CONCLUSION FROM THE BIBLICAL NARRATIVE THAT IT WAS FROM THE KENITES THAT MOSES FIRST LEARNED OF YAHWEH OR AS THE DISTINCTIVE NAME OF ISRAEL'S GOD WAS TRANSLATED BY LATER TO ITS TRIBES JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0036 THE WILDERNESS WITH ITS LURKING FOES THE EVER PRESENT DREAD OF HUNGER AND THIRST DEEPENED THE SENSE OF NEED AND OF DEPENDENCE UPON THE POWER ABLE TO GUIDE THE DESTINIES OF MEN
2609-156975-0038 THE CONSTANT NECESSITY OF MEETING THE DANGERS OF THE WILDERNESS AND DEFENDING THE FLOCKS ENTRUSTED TO MOSES' CARE DEVELOPED HIS COURAGE AND POWER OF LEADERSHIP AND ACTION
2609-156975-0023 LATER HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE COURT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL KINGS IN CENTRAL PALESTINE WHERE HE MARRIED AND BECAME IN TIME A PROSPEROUS LOCAL PRINCE
2609-156975-0034  THE CRUEL FATE OF HIS PEOPLE AND THE PAINFUL EXPERIENCE IN EGYPT THAT HAD DRIVEN HIM INTO THE WILDERNESS PREPARED HIS MIND TO RECEIVE THIS TRAINING
2609-156975-0037 THE PEASANTS OF THE VAST AND FERTILE PLAIN OF CENTRAL ASIA MINOR STILL CALL EVERY LAMP GIVEN SPRING GOD GIVEN
367-293981-0010 SANCHO GOT UP WITH PAIN ENOUGH IN HIS BONES AND WENT AFTER THE INNKEEPER IN THE DARK AND MEETING THE OFFICER WHO WAS LOOKING TO SEE WHAT HAD BECOME OF HIS ENEMY HE SAID TO HIM SIGNOR WHOEVER YOU ARE DO US THE FAVOR AND KINDNESS TO GIVE US A LITTLE ROSEMARY OIL SALT AND WINE FOR IT IS WANT TO CURE ONE OF OUR BEST KNIGHTS ERRANT ON EARTH WHO LIES ON YONDER BED WOUNDED BY THE HANDS OF THE ENCHANTED MOOR THAT IS INN
367-293981-0020 SANCHO TOOK IT AND AS HE WAS RAISING IT TO HIS MOUTH HE WAS STOPPED BY THE CRIES OF HIS MASTER EXCLAIMING SANCHO MY SON DRINK NOT WATER DRINK IT NOT MY SON FOR IT WILL KILL THEE SEE HERE I HAVE THE BLESSED BALSAM AND IF THOU DRINK TWO DROPS OF IT THOU WILT CERTAINLY BE RESTORED
367-293981-0018  THE CRIES OF THE POOR BLANKETED WRETCH WERE SO LOUD THAT THEY REACHED THE EARS OF HIS MASTER WHO HALTING TO LISTEN ATTENTIVELY WAS PERSUADED THAT SOME NEW ADVENTURE WAS COMING UNTIL HE CLEARLY PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS HIS SQUIRE WHO UTTERED THEM
367-293981-0015  SEARCH YOUR MEMORY AND IF YOU FIND ANYTHING OF THIS KIND YOU NEED ONLY TELL ME OF IT AND I PROMISE YOU BY THE ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED TO PROCURE YOU SATISFACTION AND REPARATION TO THE UTMOST OF YOUR DESIRE
367-293981-0011 TO BE BRIEF HE TOOK THE MIXTURES OF WHICH HE MADE A COMPOUND MIXING THEM ALL AND BOILING THEM A GOOD WHILE UNTIL IT SEEMED TO HIM THEY HAD COME TO PERFECTION
3764-168670-0000  THE STRIDES OF A LAME MAN ARE LIKE THE OGLING GLANCES OF A ONE EYED MAN THEY DO NOT REACH THEIR GOAL VERY PROMPTLY
367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN A PIGSKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013  DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0019 HE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOWED HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LAUGHED
367-293981-0008 MY COULD SPEAK TOO SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT THAT IS NOT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT WHAT WE SEE IS THE ENCHANTED MOOR
1688-142285-0008  HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009  WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARD TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0015 HOW QUAINT IT ASKED HER FATHER
1688-142285-0002  YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0014 SO THEY LEFT MILTON
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBERS SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0022  JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0018  AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0030  SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN A BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS A CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
2609-156975-0033 MOSES IN THE HOME OF THE MIDIAN PRIESTS WAS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THAT JEHOVAH WORSHIP
2609-156975-0026 THE PRIEST OF THE SUBLIME OF THE CANITES RECEIVED HIM INTO HIS HOME AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER IN MARRIAGE
2609-156975-0032 THE TIDE OF HIS FINDING IN ALL IMPLIES AT THIS PRIEST MINISTERED AT SOME GLITTERINATE SANCTUARY
2609-156975-0028 HERE MOSES LEARN THE LESSONS THAT WERE ESSENTIAL FOR HIS TRAINING AS A LEADER AND DELIVERER OF HIS PEOPLE
2609-156975-0031 DO THE GREAT SEABIRD TRADITIONS IMPLY THAT THE INCESSERS OF THE ISRAELITES WERE WORSHIPPED OF JEHOVAH
2609-156975-0029 AFTER THE CAPTURE OF JERICHO CERTAIN THOSE THEM WENT UP WITH A SUDDEN TRIUMPH TO CONQUER SOUTHERN PALESTINE
2609-156975-0025 THE STORY OF MOSES IS IN MANY WAYS CLOSELY PARALLEL TO THAT SINUENT
2609-156975-0035 HIS QUEST WAS FOR JUSTICE AND STRONG GUN ABLE TO DRIVER THE OPPRESSED
2609-156975-0027 NOTE THE CARE OF HIS RICH ESTATE ORIENTATION OF MARRIES
2609-156975-0024  THE SCHOOL OF THE WILDERNESS
3528-168669-0016  THAT IS GOOD REVEREND MOTHER I WILL OPEN THE VAULT
3528-168669-0024  FATHER FERVENT REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0018  GIVE ME YOUR ORDERS VERY REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0019 FULLY WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOU
3528-168669-0017  WILL THAT BE ALL NO
3528-168669-0020  I AM HERE TO DO ANYTHING YOU WISH
3528-168669-0009  A WOMAN IS NEVER A MAN
3528-168669-0013 AND CAN YOU GET A LOVER?
3528-168669-0014  THERE IS A RING IN THE STONE
3528-168669-0015 I WILL PUT THE LEVER THROUGH IT
3528-168669-0008  IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR IT
3528-168656-0009  THEY LOST THEMSELVES IN CONJECTURES
3528-168656-0006  SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THE SUBJECT TO ANY ONE
3528-168669-0002  FATHER FAUVENT
3528-168669-0010 BECAUSE DOM MABILLON GIVES FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN EPISTLES OF SAINT BERNARD WHILE MABILLON'S HORSES ONLY GIVES THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN I DO NOT DESPISE MABILLON'S HORSES NEITHER DO I
3528-168669-0011  MARRIAGE CONSISTS IN WORKING ACCORDING TO ONE'S STRENGTH A CLOISTER IS NOT A DOCKYARD
3528-168669-0021 AND TO HOLD YOUR PEACE ABOUT EVERYTHING YES RATHER ANOTHER
3528-168669-0012  AND A WOMAN IS NOT A MAN BUT MY BROTHER IS THE STRONG ONE THOUGH
3528-168669-0022 WHEN THE VAULT IS OPEN I WILL CLOSE IT AGAIN
3528-168669-0023  BUT BEFORE THAT WHAT REVEREND MOTHER
3005-163390-0018 WELL HENRY HE TAKES A NOTION HE WANTS TO GET UP SOME TROUBLE WITH THIS COUNTRY
3005-163390-0020  ALL I SAY IS KINGS AS KINGS AND YE GOT TO MAKE ALLOWANCES
3005-163390-0013 WELL IT DON'T BECAUSE IT'S IN THE BREEZE I RECKON THEY'RE ALL ALIGHT
3005-163390-0010  WE NEVER SHOWED A LIGHT TILL WE WAS ABOUT TEN MILE BELOW THE VILLAGE
3005-163390-0008 YOU BET IT IS THE JUDGE IS RIGHT EVERYBODY SINGS OUT
3005-163390-0006  JUST A WORD GENTLEMEN THEY STOPPED TO LISTEN
3005-163390-0019  S'POSE HE OPENED HIS MOUTH WHAT THEN
3005-163390-0011  GREENHORNS FLAT HEADS
3005-163390-0012 NO I SAY IT DON'T
3005-163390-0017 RING UP FAIR ROSEMOND
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY, SKIMMING EACH TIME, AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0014  MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUITPACE SERVE THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT, IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR, FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0006  IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE, THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUIT BY SYRUP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY, IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON PEELS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0018  CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0008  FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE, THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN, AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST, SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER, BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
3528-168656-0007  THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENT
3528-168669-0001  WE WILL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHIC REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR IN PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES
3528-168669-0000  THE PRIORUS RETURNED AND SEATED HERSELF ONCE MORE ON HER CHAIR
3528-168669-0007 THE SLAB WHICH CLOSES THE VAULT YES
3528-168669-0003  REVEREND MOTHER DO YOU KNOW THE CHAPEL
3528-168669-0005 THERE IS A STONE TO BE RAISED, HEAVY
3528-168669-0006  THE SLAB OF THE PAVEMENT WHICH IS AT THE SIDE OF THE ALTAR
3528-168656-0008  SOME UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELIC
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE COLIC
2033-164916-0001  NO O CHIEF WAZIR THAT HERE WHERE YOU HAVE ENCOUNTERED ME ALLAH HATH GIVEN YOU REST FROM FATIGUE AND BRINGETH YOU YOUR DESIRE AFTER THE EASIEST OF FASHIONS FOR THAT HIS ALMIGHTY WILL RESTORETH TO YOU ZAWARMAN AND HIS SISTER NUZAT AL ZAMAN WHEREBY WE WILL SETTLE THE MATTER AS WE EASILY CAN
2033-164915-0017  AND AMONGST THEM WERE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THE CADET ZAWAR MAKAN FOR QUOTH THEY HIS NAME BE LIGHT OF THE PLACE AND HE HATH A SISTER NUZHAT AL ZAMAN HIES THE DELIGHT OF THE TIME BUT THEY SET OUT FIVE YEARS AGO FOR ALHIJAS AND NONE WOTTETH WHAT IS BECOME OF THEM
2033-164915-0006 THE CHAMBERLAIN CALLED THE CASTRATO AND CHARGED HIM TO DO ACCORDINGLY SO HE REPLIED I HEAR AND I OBEY AND HE TOOK HIS PAGES WITH HIM AND WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF THE STALKER TILL HE FOUND HIM IN THE REAR OF THE CARAVAN GIRDING HIS ASS AND PREPARING FOR FLIGHT
2033-164916-0003 ZAWAR MAKAN BOWED HIS HEAD AWHILE AND THEN SAID I ACCEPT THE POSITION FOR INDEED THERE WAS NO REFUSING AND HE WAS CERTIFIED THAT THE CHAMBERLAIN HAD COUNSELLED HIM WELL AND WISELY
2033-164915-0013  AND HE ANSWERED I AM THE CHAMBERLAIN OF THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS KING SHARKAN SONG OVER MAR BINAL LUUMAN LORD OF WAGDAD AND OF THE LAND OF KHORASAN AND I BRING TRIBUTE AND PRESENTS FROM HIM TO HIS FATHER IN BAGHDAD
2033-164916-0002  WHEN THE MINISTER HEARD THESE WORDS HE REJOICED WITH GREAT JOY AND SAID O CHAMBERLAIN TELL ME THE TALE OF THE TWAIN AND WHAT BEFELL THEM AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR LONG ABSENCE
2033-164915-0015 THEN HE BADE HIM BE SEATED AND QUESTIONED HIM AND HE REPLIED THAT HE WAS TREMBLING TO THE EMIR OF DAMASCUS AND WAS BOUND TO KING OMAR WITH PRESENTS AND THE TRIBUTE OF SYRIA
2033-164915-0007  SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN THE TALKER GIRDED HIS ASS FOR FLIGHT AND BESPEAKE HIMSELF SAYING OH WOULD I KNEW WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM
2033-164915-0008  I BELIEVE HE HATH DENOUNCED ME TO THE EUNUCH HENCE THESE PAGES AT ABOUT ME AND HE HATH MADE ME AN ACCOMPLICE IN HIS CRIME
2033-164915-0016  SO IT WAS AGREED THAT WE GO TO DAMASCUS AND FETCH THENCE THE KING'S SON SHARKAN AND MAY HIM SULTAN OVER HIS FATHER'S REALM
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0017  WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UP ON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0021  MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0016 OFTEN BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0029 THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
1688-142285-0027  I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0026  PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL
1688-142285-0020  IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0025 WHAT CAN I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0019  NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
1998-29455-0005 THERE ONLY READS SAID BEALE
1998-29455-0007  AY THERE GOES A RABBIT
1998-29455-0027 THE NEW GAME OF BEGGING AND INVENTING STORIES TO INTEREST THE PEOPLE FROM WHOM IT WAS WORTH WHILE TO BEG WHERE JOHN GAILY DAY BY DAY AND WEEK BY WEEK AND DICKY BY CONSTANT PRACTICE GREW SO CLEVER TAKING HIS PART IN THE ACTING THAT MISTER BEER WAS QUITE DAZED WITH ADMIRATION
1998-29455-0026 THE NIGHT IS FULL OF INTERESTING LITTLE SOUNDS THAT WILL NOT AT FIRST LET YOU SLEEP THE RUSTLE OF LITTLE WHITE THINGS AND THE HATCHES THE BARKING OF DOGS AND DISTANT FARMS THE CHIRP OF CRICKETS AND THE CROAKING OF FROGS
1998-29455-0035 IF ANY ONE ASKS YOU IF YOU EVER SEE HIM YOU NEVER SET EYES ON HIM IN ALL YOUR BORN NEVER REMEMBER HIM
1998-29455-0030 I AM SURE AS I HAD BETTER STICK TO THE ROAD AND KEEP AWAY FROM OLD ANNE'S LA CUJAM
1998-29455-0031 I HOPE HE'S CLEVER ENOUGH TO DO WHAT HE'S TOLD HE WAS MARKED AT THAT'S ALL
1998-29455-0028 BLEST IF I EVER SEE SUCH A NIBBLE HE SAID OVER AND OVER AGAIN
1998-29455-0023 TO THE OTHER TRAMP LIES IN BEGGING WHERE NATURAL MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD
1998-29455-0033 SEE THAT BLOATED IS NOW SAID MISTER BEALE YES SAID DICKIE
3528-168669-0048 FAUCHELEVENT THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A PRAYER WHICH SHE WAS FINISHING
3528-168669-0043 FATHER FAUCHELEVENT THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN BLESSED IN MOTHER CRUCIFIXION
3528-168669-0055  THE DEAD MUST BE OBEYED SO BE IT
3528-168669-0051 FORTUNATELY THE PRIORESS COMPLETELY ABSORBED IN HER OWN THOUGHTS DID NOT HEAR IT
3528-168669-0049  FAUCHELEVENT HELD HIS PEACE SHE WENT ON
3528-168669-0044  SHE RETAINED HER CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE VERY LAST MOMENT
3528-168669-0052 SHE CONTINUED FURTHER FAUCHELEVENT
3528-168669-0047  THERE WAS SOMETHING OF PARADISE IN THAT DEATH
3528-168669-0056  FOR THAT MATTER NO REVEREND MOTHER
3528-168669-0041  FAUCHELEVENT MOPPED HIS FOREHEAD
3528-168669-0061  THE FOUR MOTHER PERCENTERS WILL ASSIST YOU
3528-168669-0072 THINK FATHER FOR A MOMENT IF SHE WERE TO WORK MIRACLES HERE
3528-168669-0065  UNDER THE ALTAR BUT

3528-168669-0063 WHERE INTO THE VAULT
3528-168669-0058  IT IS A CONTINUATION OF HER SLUMBER
3528-168669-0062 NO IN LOWERING THE COFFIN
3528-168669-0070  BUT IT IS FORBIDDEN
3528-168669-0082  HIS ORDER HAS PRODUCED FORTY POPES TWO HUNDRED CARDINALS FIFTY PATRIARCHS SIXTEEN HUNDRED ARCHBISHOPS FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED BISHOPS FOUR EMPERORS TWELVE EMPRESSES FORTY SIX KINGS FORTY ONE QUEENS THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED CANONIZED SAINTS AND HAS BEEN IN EXISTENCE FOR FOURTEEN HUNDRED YEARS
3528-168669-0076 SHONO DE MER ONE OF THE SEVEN GERMAN KINGS WHO ENTERED AMONG THE GAULS UNDER THE EMPIRE OF CONSTANTIUS EXPRESSLY RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT OF NUNS TO BE BURIED IN RELIGION THAT IS TO SAY BENEATH THE ALTAR
3528-168669-0079 THE PRIEST WHO WAS USUALLY SUBJECTED TO THE BARRIER OF SILENCE AND WHOSE RESERVOIR WAS OVER FULL ROSE AND EXCLAIMED WITH THE LOQUACITY OF A DAM WHICH HAS BROKEN AWAY
3528-168669-0078  MARTIN THE ELEVENTH GENERAL OF THE CARTHUSIANS GAVE TO HIS ORDER THIS DEVICE STAT CREW DOOM VOLVETURE ORBIS
3528-168669-0084 GOD SUBORDINATED TO THE COMMISSARY OF POLICE SUCH AS THE AGE SILENCE FAVORED
3528-168669-0080 I HAVE ON MY RIGHT BENOÎT AND ON MY LEFT BERNARD WHO WAS BERNARD
3528-168669-0083  ON ONE SIDE SAINT BERNARD ON THE OTHER THE AGENT OF THE SANITARY DEPARTMENT
3528-168669-0073  WHAT A GLORY OF GOD FOR THE COMMUNITY AND MIRACLES ISSUE FROM TOMBS
3528-168669-0074 BUT REVEREND MOTHER IS THE AGENT OF THE SANITARY COMMISSION
3528-168669-0085 NO ONE DOUBTS THE RIGHT OF THE MONASTERY TO SEPULTURE
3528-168669-0086  ONLY FANATICS AND THOSE IN ERROR DENY IT
3528-168669-0077  THE WORLD IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CROSS
2414-159411-0023  SHOW ME THE PACE
2414-159411-0027  WHERE WAS THE TIGER THEN
2414-165385-0001 THAT HIS SOUL MIGHT AFTERWARDS OCCUPY SUCH A STATION AS WOULD BE MOST SUITABLE TO HIS CHARACTER IT WAS INTENDED TO INHABIT THE BODY OF THAT FINICAL GRINNING AND MISSIONLESS LITTLE MIMIC WITH FOUR LEGS WHICH YOU NOW BEHOLD BEFORE YOU
2414-165385-0000 AND THUS ACCOMPLISHED HE EXCITED ADMIRATION OF EVERY SILLY CROCKET AND THE ENVY OF EVERY FLUTTERING PEACOMB BUT BY ALL YOUNG GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF UNDERSTANDING HE WAS HEARTILY DESPISED AS A MERE CIVILISED MONKEY
2609-156975-0004 EVERY ONE WHOSE TRUMPET HAS BEEN FOUND BLOWING MANETH BATH THE TESTIMONY OF THE OLDEST BIBLICAL NARRATIVE REGARDING THE SOJOURN OF THE HEBREWS IN EGYPT IS ALSO IN PERFECT ACCORD WITH THE PICTURE WHICH THE CONTEMPORARY EGYPTIAN INSCRIPTIONS GIVE THE PERIOD
2609-156975-0002 LET US HAVE FAITH THAT RIGHT MAKES MIGHT AND IN THAT FAITH LET US DARE TO DO OUR DUTY AS WE UNDERSTAND IT LINCOLN
2609-156975-0006 IT SEEMS PROBABLE THAT NOT ALL BUT ONLY PART OF THE TRIBES ULTIMATELY COALESCED INTO THE HEBREW NATION FOUND THEIR WAY TO EGYPT
2414-159411-0032  WHEN THE BRAHMAN HAD TURNED THIS THE JACKAL SAID OH YOU'RE WICKED AND UNGRATEFUL TIGER
2414-159411-0029  VERY GOOD SAID THE JACKAL BUT I CANNOT JUDGE WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THE WHOLE MATTER EXACTLY
2414-159411-0033 WHEN A GOOD BRAHMAN OPENED YOUR CAGE TO RELEASE YOU THE ONLY RETURN HE WOULD MAKE
3528-168669-0033  HEY MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0040  IT CUT MORE OFTEN SHORT
3528-168669-0025  YOU KNOW THAT A MOTHER DIED THIS MORNING
3528-168669-0037  BUT I DID NOT SAY MORE OFTEN
3528-168669-0029  IT WAS MOTHER CRUCIFIX
3528-168669-0034  WHAT DO YOU SAY
3528-168669-0054 SAINT TERENTIUS BISHOP OF PORT WHERE THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER EMPTIES INTO THE SEA REQUESTED THAT ON HIS TOMB MIGHT BE ENGRAVED THE SIGN WHICH WAS PLACED ON THE GRAVES OF PARRICIDES IN THE HOPE THAT PASSERSBY WOULD SPIT ON HIS TOMB THIS WAS DONE
3528-168669-0050  I HAVE CONSULTED UPON THIS POINT MANY ECCLESIASTICS LABOURING IN OUR LORD WHO OCCUPY THEMSELVES IN THE EXERCISES OF THE CLERICAL LIFE AND WHO BEAR WONDERFUL FRUIT
3528-168669-0046  IF YOU HAD A LITTLE MORE FAITH AND IF YOU COULD HAVE BEEN IN HERSELF SHE WOULD HAVE CURED YOUR LEG MERELY BY TOUCHING IT SHE SMILED
3528-168669-0042 IN HER LIFETIME MOTHER CRUCIFIX MADE CONVERTS AFTER HER DEATH SHE WILL PERFORM MIRACLES SHE WILL
3080-5040-0003  I WONDER HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0009  YOU SEE I GIVE YOU FAIR WARNING
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGH TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSEN
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHIDE WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
3080-5040-0032  IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0022  BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I READ BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0029  HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS THE FINEST BOY THAT ERE YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0024  FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU HAD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER KITTEN OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF HER AIM
3080-5040-0027  WELL IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVEMONTH TO GAIN ALL THAT KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN

1998-29454-0011  WHEN IT WAS OVER THE MAN ASKED DICKIE IF HE COULD WALK A LITTLE WAY AND WHEN DICKY SAID HE COULD THEY SET OUT IN THE MOST FRIENDLY WAY SIDE BY SIDE
1998-29454-0004  WHEN DICKIE CAME DOWN HIS AUNT SADLY SLAPPED HIM AND HE TOOK THE HALFPENNY AND LIMPED OFF OBEDIENTLY
2609-157645-0004 ON ONE OCCASION HE WAS AT SAINT MARY'S CHURCH NINEHAM FOR A CONFIRMATION
2609-157645-0003 BLACKBURN ARTISTS OF YORK WAS A GREAT SMOKER
2609-157645-0010  THEN LET THEM SING THE HUNDRED AND NINETEENTH REPLIED THE CURATE
2609-157645-0012  DAVID DEAN SAVAGE DID NOT AT ALL PROVE THIS IRREVERENCE
2609-157645-0008 LET THEM SING ANOTHER PSALM SAID TO THE CURATE
2609-157645-0009  THEY HAVE SIR REPLIED THE CLERK
2609-169640-0004 MISTER MARBLE HE OUGHT TO BELIEVE WAS FAIRLY MUSING ON THE HENCOOPS BEGAN LIKE THE SAILS AS ONE MIGHT SAY VARIOUS SLEEP
2609-169640-0002 FORTUNATELY THE YOUNG WAS NOT ONLY FAT BUT SHE MINDED HER HAIR AS THE LIGHTFOOTED GIRL TURNED IN A LIVELY DANCE
2609-169640-0011 BISHOP KITE DESERVED THE SORROWFUL REMARK THAT OUR MOVEMENTS HAD BEEN SO PROMPT AS TO TAKE THE REST WERE TAKEN ABACK
2609-169640-0001 NOW OR AFTER THE SUN HAD SET THE WIND FELL TO A LIGHT AIR TO HUNT IT IN IS KEPT STEERAGE WAY ON THE SHIP
3528-168669-0114  YOU WILL DO IT AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE
3528-168669-0120  HOWEVER NEVER MIND I SHALL HAVE MY LOVER
3528-168669-0112  REVEREND MOTHER WHAT
3528-168669-0106 HE WILL PAY IT AT FOUR O'CLOCK TODAY
3528-168669-0109  THAT IS WELL FATHER FERVENT
3528-168669-0110  WHERE WILL YOU OBTAIN IT
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SURF AND APPLY TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SURF WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0003  BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
2609-156975-0005 THE ABSENCE OF THE DETAILED REFERENCE TO THE HEBREWS IS THEREFORE PERFECTLY NATURAL
2609-156975-0001 OR ONE WHO FIGHTS HOLDS OUT PATIENCE AS HIS GENIUS
2609-156975-0000 THE MOSES WERE AFRAID AND SAID SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN
2414-159411-0035 HE REALIZED THAT WAY IN MIND THIS
2609-156975-0003  THE EGYPTIAN BACKGROUND OF THE BONDAGE
2414-159411-0031  THEN SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE JACKAL
2414-159411-0030 SHUT AND BOLTED SAID THE BRAHMIN
2414-159411-0034 PROCEED ON YOUR JOURNEY FRIEND BRAHMIN
2609-156975-0007 THE STORIES REGARDING JOSEPH, THEIR TRADITIONAL FATHER, THAT FROM MANASSEH INCLINE THAT THESE STRONG CENTRAL TRIBES, POSSIBLY TOGETHER WITH THE SOUTHERN TRIBES OF BENJAMIN AND JUDAH, WERE THE CHIEF ACTORS AND ITS HELPING SCENE IN ISRAEL'S HISTORY
2609-156975-0022 THESE STAND WANDERERS SENT HIM ON FROM TIME TO TRIBE UNTIL HE REACHED THE LAND OF CUSH BEYOND THE DEAD SEA WHERE HE REMAINED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SO INVITED IT MOST
3331-159609-0023  FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN OTHER DARKNESS
3528-168656-0004  IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0001  IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINDOW FROM THE LAST ABOVE THE GIRLS
3528-168656-0005  THE RULE OF FONTREVAL DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0000  SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3331-159609-0016 SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL AT ONCE
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING, FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY, BUT THE DANCERS LAUGH WITH A SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0010  WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3005-163391-0004 WHAT ARE YOU BOUND FOR, YOUNG MAN
3005-163390-0029 I LAY I'LL MAKE YOU MINE
3005-163390-0024  THIS ONE'S A MIDDLIN HARD LOT FOR A DUKE
3005-163390-0030  JUST AS LOUD AS I COULD YELL
3005-163391-0005  GET ABOARD SAYS THE KING
3005-163390-0022  WELL THEY ALL DO JIM
3005-163391-0018 BLAMED IF HE DIDN'T INQUIRE ABOUT EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING IN THAT BLESSED TOWN AND ALL ABOUT THE WILKES AND ABOUT PETER'S BUSINESS WHICH WAS A TANNER AND ABOUT GEORGE'S WHICH WAS A CARPENTER AND ABOUT HARVEY WHICH WAS A DISSENTING MINISTER AND SO ON AND SO ON THEN HE SAYS
3005-163391-0011 YOU SEE HE WAS PRETTY OLD AND GEORGE'S GIRLS WERE TOO YOUNG TO BE MUCH COMPANY FOR HIM EXCEPT MARY JANE THE RED HEADED AND SO HE WAS KIND OF LONESOME AFTER GEORGE AND HIS WIFE DIED AND DIDN'T SEEM TO CARE MUCH TO LIVE
3005-163391-0008  HE ASKED THE KING WHERE HE WAS GOING AND THE KING TOLD HIM HE'D COME DOWN TO RIVER AND LANDED AT THE OTHER VILLAGE THIS MORNING AND NOW HE WAS GOING UP A FEW MILE TO SEE AN OLD FRIEND ON A FARM UP THERE THE YOUNG FELLOW SAYS
3005-163391-0015  MARY JANE'S NINETEEN SUSAN'S FIFTEEN AND JOANNA'S ABOUT FOURTEEN THAT'S THE ONE THAT GIVES HERSELF TO GOOD WORKS AND HAS A HARE LIP POOR THINGS
1688-142285-0093 TAKE NOTICE THAT THIS IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS, PAPA, IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL, WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO, THOUGH YOU ARE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT
1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL, ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANYONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
1688-142285-0084 WHY, I WOULD APPLY TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS
1688-142285-0094  I DON'T KNOW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS HERS EITHER BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHERED FROM HIM I FANCY SO
1688-142285-0087 MR. THORNTON, THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS, I BELIEVE, SAID MR. HALE QUIETLY
1688-142285-0088 I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER. SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON, HER MOTHER ADDED
1688-142285-0081 EVERYBODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY. NOW LET ME TRY
1688-142285-0089  PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
1688-142285-0091 MY DEAR, SAID MR. HALE, ALARMED, PRAY DON'T GO OFF ON THAT IDEA
1688-142285-0095  THEY CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER
3538-163624-0005  HE IS NO BIGGER THAN OTHER DRAGON SAID THE TUTOR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRAVE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
3538-163624-0016 THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGIN AND REGIN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFNIR'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
3538-163624-0006  THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD KILLED OTTER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE DWARF WHO OWNED ALL THE TREASURE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGIN
3538-163624-0004  THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRIVE ALL THE HORSES INTO THE RIVER AND CHOOSE THE ONE THAT SWIMS ACROSS
3538-163624-0008 SO REGIN MADE A SWORD AND SIGURD TRIED IT WITH A BLOW ON A LUMP OF IRON AND THE SWORD BROKE
3538-163624-0007  ONLY ONE RING WAS LEFT WHICH THE DWARF WORE AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
3538-163624-0014 BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
3538-163624-0013  SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
3538-163624-0015 GUY THOU FASTER AND THEN FAFNIR DIED
3080-5040-0030  YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THUS WITH DISCOURSES OF A FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTHS THAN THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING IT
3080-5040-0026 WE GO ABROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAYERS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
3080-5040-0021  YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE OF THIS THAT I ESCAPE DROWNING
3080-5040-0023  HOW WELCOME YOU WILL BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0018  DIRECTED FOR YOUR MASTER
3080-5040-0028  WILL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED
3080-5040-0017  BUT I AM CALLED UPON
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THE WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOUR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DARK HEART WORKING DAYS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE THIS ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS WITH THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASCOD WITH NINE PEAS INTO UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY IT WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING? ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0006  AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME, GO SAID THE HEAD
3538-142836-0023  ICES
3538-163619-0013  THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN THEY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON ME UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOOLS FOR A LONG, LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED, HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF, AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0011  THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS, LET THE FOOLS WANDER WHERE THEY CHOSE, AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
2414-159411-0007 THE TIGER SAID THE BRAMIN BEG ME TO LET HIM OUT OF HIS CAGE TO DRINK A LITTLE WATER AND HE PROMISED NOT TO HARM ME IF I DID SO BUT NOW THAT I HAVE LEFT HIM OUT HE WISHES TO EAT ME
2414-159411-0004 THEN THE BRAMIN TOOK PITY ON HIM AND OPENED THE CAGE DOOR BUT NO SOONER HAD HE TURNED AROUND THAN THE TIGER JUMPING OUT SAID HOW I WILL EAT YOU FIRST AND DRINK THE WATER AFTERWARDS
2414-159411-0005 SO THE BRAMMAN AND THE TIGER WALKED ON TILL THEY CAME TO A BANANA TREE AND THE BRAMMAN SAID TO IT BANANA TREE BANANA TREE HERE AND GIVE JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0000  ONCE UPON A TIME A BRAMIN WHO WAS WALKING ALONG THE ROAD CAME UPON AN IRON CAGE IN WHICH A GREAT TIGER HAD BEEN SHUT UP BY THE VILLAGERS WHO CAUGHT HIM
2414-159411-0001 THE BRAMMIN ANSWERED NO I HAVE A REASON FOR IF I LET YOU OUT OF THE CAGE YOU WILL EAT ME
2414-159411-0003  I WILL NEVER BE SO UNGRATEFUL ONLY LET ME OUT THAT I MAY DRINK SOME WATER AND RETURN
2414-159411-0010 SIR COW SIR COW CRIED THE BRAHMAN HERE AND GIVE YOUR JUDGMENT
2414-159411-0002  O FATHER OF MERCY ANSWERED THE TIGER IN TRUTH THAT I WILL NOT
2414-159411-0009 LET THE TIGER EAT THE MAN FOR MEN ARE AN UNGRATEFUL RACE
2414-128292-0031 THOU POOR ROVER AND RAMBLER THOU TRIED BUT TO FLY
1688-142285-0038  BETTER AND NOT BETTER IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039  NOT EXACTLY REPLIED MARGARET SMILING
1688-142285-0043  AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
1688-142285-0044  BESSY DO YOU WISH TO DIE
1688-142285-0042  BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0046  NOT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
1688-142285-0037 WELL BESSY HOW ARE YOU
1688-142285-0047  BUT WHAT WAS IT
1688-142285-0060  BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0057  MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
3538-142836-0000  JAIL OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ISISS AND DESSERT DISHES
3538-142836-0005  LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3528-168669-0129  I WILL PUT EARTH IN THE COFFIN REVEREND MOTHER THAT WILL PRODUCE THE EFFECT OF A CORPSE
3528-168669-0128  HE MADE HASTE TO IMPROVISE AN EXPEDIENT TO MAKE HER FORGET THE OATH
3528-168669-0126  AH LIDA EXCLAIMED FAUCHELEVENT
3528-168669-0123  THE EMPTY COFFIN REMAINS THIS PRODUCED A PAUSE
3528-168669-0125  IT WILL BE GIVEN TO THE EARTH EMPTY
3528-168669-0127  THE VEAL STUCK FAST IN HIS THROAT
3528-168669-0124  WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THAT COFFIN FATHER PREVENT
3528-168669-0121  AFTER WHICH THERE WILL BE NO TRACE OF ANYTHING
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I WEAKLY THOUGHT HE DID
3331-159605-0035  UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0042  I JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0039 TRULY JULIE FAN
3331-159605-0038  DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
3331-159605-0034  PERHAPS SHE HAD CHILLED HIM
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS HER TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANCE THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER AND ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL-ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR
3331-159609-0000  NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFERS TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOWN WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERYONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE ENGINE COMES SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENDED ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THAT THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
1998-29454-0024 THE SUN SHOT LONG GOLDEN BEAMS THROUGH THE GAPS AND THE HATCH
1998-29454-0029  THEN HE FOLDED IT AND PUT IT IN HIS POCKET
1998-29454-0022 WELL I'LL SHOW YOU THE SORT OF MEN I AM
1998-29454-0032 I SEE THAT THEN HE LOOKED SAID DICKIE CHARMED
1998-29454-0035  ADVENTURES I SHOULD THINK SO
1998-29454-0031  THEY COULD PUT A MAN AWAY FOR LESS THAN THAT
1998-29454-0021 I ENTERED HERE HAVE I LIKE WHAT YOU ARE INTO
1998-29454-0034 WILD ONES AND A HALF SIZE I SAY
1998-29454-0028 KATUS RODE DOWN THEN GONE
1998-29454-0030 NOW WE ARE CLEAR HE SAID
367-130732-0004 A BOOK COULD BE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT AND THEN ALL WOULD NOT BE TOLD FOR ALL ITS SECRETS CAN NEVER BE KNOWN
3538-163624-0021  THEN HE TOOK THE HELMET OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEPER AND BEHOLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
3538-163624-0025  FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
3538-163624-0019 THAT LET HIM DO THEN RIDE OVER HENFELL TO THE PLACE WHERE BRYNHILD SLEEPS
3538-163624-0022  THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
367-130732-0001  WHEN IS A LOBSTER NOT A LOBSTER WHEN IT IS A CRAYFISH
367-130732-0000  LOBSTERS AND LOBSTERS
367-130732-0006 LOBSTER OR NEWBURG
367-130732-0013 GOBY'S PASSED WITH THE FIRE AND THE LITTLE RESTAURANT BEARING HIS NAME AND IN CHARGE OF HIS WIDOW IN UNION SQUARE AVENUE HAS NOT ATTAINED THE FAME OF THE OLD PLACE
367-130732-0014 IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHE KNOWS THE SECRET OF PREPARING CRAB AS IT WAS PREPARED IN THE GOBY'S OF BEFORE THE FIRE BUT HIS PROCEEDS DID NOT DESCEND TO HER
3538-163619-0009  ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0004  WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-142836-0022  THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-163619-0007  WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0010  SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0005 THESE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-142836-0024  AT DESERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-142836-0025 THE SPATULA IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-163619-0002  BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE

3331-159605-0014 PARTLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LAUGH FEATHERS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LAUGH CAN BE TRULY PAID

3538-163622-0019  FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EVEN DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY CHOL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163624-0002  BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0001  THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND THOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW

3528-168669-0103 A PAUSE AND SUIT
2609-169640-0014 I HEARD THE RIDING OF THE BOARDING PINS AS THEY WERE CUT ADRIFT FROM THE SPANKER BOOM AND FELL UPON THE DECKS
2609-169640-0007 HE WAS TIMID OF THE SEAMEN TO REQUIRE SECOND LOOK IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN BUT IT WAS TO BE DONE
2609-169640-0010 I SOON SAW BOTH PARTICIPANTS IN GRINDING UP WAS I SHOULD PERCEIVE THAT THEY HAD NOT APPROACHED MATERIALLY NEAR
2609-169640-0009  AS OUR SEATS WERE OFF LYING FORWARD AND REMAINED SO FOR A FEW MINUTES IT GAVE ME A LEISURE TO LOOK ABOUT
2609-169640-0005 AT THAT MOMENT IRON NOISE WENT FORTH TO SEAMEN THAT OF AN OAR FOLLOWING IN THE BOAT
2609-169640-0008 ALTHOUGH THEY WENT THREE FEET TO OUR TWO THIS GAVE US A MOMENT OF BREATHING TIME
2609-169640-0015  KITE WENT AFT AND RETURNED WITH THREE OR FOUR MUSKETS AND AS MANY PIKES
2609-169640-0003 I NEVER WAS IN THE BETTER STEERING SUPPOSEDLY SPETRY AND MODERATE WEATHER
2609-169640-0013  THE PROTEST DID NOT ENTER THE COURSE BUT NEARED AS FAST
2609-169640-0016 THE STILLNESS IN ITS RANGE ON BOTH SIDES WAS LIKE THAT OF DEATH
3538-163622-0002  HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0005 THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PUNISHED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0004  HE HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0001  THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE HOLES AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
3538-163622-0009  SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
3538-163619-0012  I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163622-0007  COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0000  WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOLDS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SAID THE LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0003  YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
533-131556-0002 THE WORDS TEARS ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM
533-1066-0023 A DOCTOR IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE HANDIER BEARING FOLKS THAN FATIGUING THEM UP
533-131556-0000 BUT HOW AM I TO HEAD OVER THE TEN OR TWELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET ELAPSE BEFORE THEY GO
533-1066-0024  I HELD ON TO HIM FRANTICALLY AND SOMEHOW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN
533-1066-0018  I CONFESS THAT JUST AT THAT MINUTE EVEN SUNNYSIDE SEEMED A CHEERFUL SPOT
533-1066-0017  THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHERE WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT
533-1066-0022  THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OF COMPLICITY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE CHATTING CONFIDENTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0020 IT WAS ALEX ARMED WITH TWO LONG-HANDLED SPADES
533-1066-0021 THE DOCTOR KEPT A KEEN LOOKOUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
3331-159605-0032  POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVOURITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FOR MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0031  HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THEY DIDN'T THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT DID THE TATTLER SAY
3331-159605-0036  MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE BOTTLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS
3331-159605-0046  I AM NOT YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159605-0037  NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS NOT HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0041  WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FRO AS USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0045  BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0044  HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A GENTLEMAN MADE NO FUSS
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VASSOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0008  MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER A GONE THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED
3080-5040-0014  INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE FOR A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
3080-5040-0006  DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0010  BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE GONE INTO KENT AND MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MRS. BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0015 BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKELY TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0012 I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST THAT MY SCHEDULED JOURNEY WAS LAID ASIDE AND THAT INTO KENT HASTENED
3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVED ME
3080-5040-0011 HERE ARE SOME VERSES OR COLONNADES TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE THEM
2414-159411-0011  AT A LITTLE DISTANCE THEY FOUND A BULLOCK LYING BY THE ROADSIDE

2414-128292-0032 WHICH THOU HAST ARRESTED IN THE HOME THIS EVENING
2414-159411-0012  IS IT FAIR THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NOT
2414-159411-0008 IS IT JUST THAT HE SHOULD DO SO OR NO
2414-128292-0030 THOU HAST STAGGERED
2414-159411-0016 THE BRAHMAN SEATED THE CASE AND THE EAGLE ANSWERED WHENEVER MEN SEE ME THEY TRY TO SHOOT ME THEY CLIMBED THEIR ROCKS AND STEAL AWAY MY LITTLE ONES
2414-159411-0020  THE BRAHMAN GAVE HIMSELF UP AS LOST BUT AGAIN HE PRAYED THE TIGER TO HAVE PATIENCE AND LET HIM ASK THE OPINION OF THE SIXTH CHURCH
2414-159411-0014 THREE OUT OF THE SIX AND GIVING JUDGMENT AGAINST THE BRAMLIN WHERE STILL HE DID NOT LOSE ALL HOPE AND DETERMINED TO ASK THE OTHER THREE
2414-159411-0022 THE BRAMMAN TOLD HIS STORY AND SAID TO HIM UNCLE JACKAL AND WISE JACKAL SAY WHAT IS YOUR JUDGMENT
1998-29455-0011 I AM GOING TO BE AT THE ROOM AND PROM IF YOU GO SOMEWHERE LIKE US IF YOU WERE A BEGGAR OF FIELDS
1998-29455-0020  THEY WENT ON UP THE HILL AS HAPPY AS ANY ONE NEED WISH TO BE
1998-29455-0015  POOR LITTLE MAN SAID THE LADY YOU MISS YOUR MOTHER DON'T YOU

533-131556-0001  FOR NONE CAN ENDURE ME AS HE HAS DONE OH
533-1066-0016  I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I EXPECTED
533-1066-0014  I ASK NO QUESTIONS
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIMULATED SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
533-131556-0012 I ENJOY HUMAN LENGTH RAMBLE AS WELL AS YOU I ANSWERED STEADILY FIXING MY EYES UPON HERB AND FERRY HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE RESORTS
533-131556-0006  I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND CONDUCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDSHIP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR TALENT FOR DISSIMULATION I CANNOT ASSUME THE APPEARANCE OF IT
533-131556-0005 THEY YET HAD TAKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK LESS TO DIVERT MY MIND THAN TO DEPRECATE CONVERSATION I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS WITH A FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED BEGAN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT RESTING HER FINGER AGAINST HER CHEEK AND GAZING INTO THE FIRE
1998-15444-0007  THE BEST DOMESTIC IS THAT WHICH IS AT HAND
1998-15444-0008 THE DISH FOR KNOWLEDGE IS TEN MINIMS
1998-15444-0025 TO PURIFY IT ADD IN A QUANTITY OF DILUTE SULFURIC ACID AND AFTER EVAPORATING TO THREE QUARTERS OF ITS BARK ADD A SATURATED SOLUTION OF CARBONATE OF POTASH SODA
1998-15444-0026 BOIL THE FINELY DIVIDED SUBSTANCE WITH ABOUT ONE EIGHTH ITS BULK OF PURE HYDROCHLORIC ACID ADD FROM TIME TO TIME POTASSIUM CHLORIDE UNTIL THE SOLIDS HAVE IT USED TO A STRAW YELLOW FLUID
1998-15444-0020 THE RESIDUE MAY BE SET ASIDE FOR THE DETECTION OF THE METALLIC POISONS OF SUSPECTED EXPELL THE ALCOHOL BY CAREFUL EVAPORATION
1998-15444-0027 THE RESIDUE OF THE MATERIAL AFTER DIGESTION WAS HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND POTASSIUM CHLORIDE MAY HAVE TO BE EXAMINED FOR SILVER LEAD AND BARIUM
1998-15444-0017 THIS PROCESS IS BASED UPON THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE SOLES OF THE ALKALIS ARE SOLUBLE IN AKILL AND WATER AND INSOLUBLE IN ETHER
1998-29454-0002 HIS BOOKS TOLD HIM THAT TREASURES BEST HIDDEN UNDER LOOSE BOARDS AND AS OF COURSE YOUR HOUSE HAS A SECRET PANEL WHICH HIS HAD NOT
1998-29454-0003 HE GOT IT UP AND PUSHED HIS TREASURES AS FAR IN AS HE COULD ALONG THE ROUGH CRUMBLY SURFACE OF THE LATH AND PLASTER
1998-15444-0019 TO COOL THE EXTENT FILTER WASH THE WEATHER DEW WITH STRONG ALCOHOL AND MIX THE FILTRATES
1688-142285-0048  YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
1688-142285-0052  AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
1688-142285-0056  BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0051  THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0053 YOU WILL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GRUFFISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0050  I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW

4852-28311-0022  ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GRAIN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28312-0000  OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND POURED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L-SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT WAS MISTER WICKER'S BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
2414-128292-0002  WHAT MATTER ABOUT MY SHADOW

4198-12259-0037  O LACHRYMA CHRISTI IT IS OF THE BEST GRAPE
2609-157645-0005 ANOTHER EIGHTEENTH CENTURY CLERICAL WORTHY, THE FAMOUS DOCTOR PARR, AN INVETERATE SMOKER, WAS ACCUSTOMED TO DO WHAT MISTER DIZZNEY PREVENTED ARCHBISHOP OF BLACKBURN FROM DOING. HE SMOKED IN HIS VESTRY AT HATTON
2609-169640-0000 PARSONS IN THAT QUARTER WERE USUALLY STRUTTED BY THE SIPS AS TRUE, BUT THE SEA IS FULL OF THEM FOR MORE ARE INNOCENT THAN GUILTY OF ANY ACTS OF VIOLENCE
2609-157645-0011 SIX ARMS, THE NEAREST WITHIN REACH, PRESENTED WITH AN OBEDIENT START AND AS MANY TOBACCO POUCHES TO THE MAN OF OFFICE
2609-157645-0006 POOR WAS SUCH A CONTINUOUS SMOKER THAT ANYONE WHO CAME INTO HIS COMPANY WHO HAD NEVER SMOKED BEFORE HAD TO LEARN THE USE OF A PIPE AS A MEANS OF SELF DEFENSE
2609-157645-0014 WHEN THESE MEN, AIMED THE COURSE OF MY REMONSTRANCE, FOUND OUT THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO CONTINUE THE COUSIN, THEY NO LONGER CARED TO BE COMMUNICANTS
2609-157645-0001 THE PROHIBITIONS AND THEIR REGULATIONS QUOTED HAD SMOKING IN SAINT MARY'S CHURCH REFERRED, IT MAY BE NOTED, TO THE ACT WHICH WAS HELD THEREIN
2609-157645-0007 ONE SUNDAY, SAYS MISTER DITFIELD, HE HANDED THAT SHARP PIPE TO CHARTER. THE CLERK TOLD HIM THAT THE PEOPLE WERE GETTING IMPATIENT
2609-157645-0000 EVIDENTLY THE INTENTION, WHICH MADE THINGS PLEASANT FOR THE ROYAL FOLK, WAS TOBACCO DURING HIS VISIT
2609-157645-0013 GOING TO CHURCH AND SAYING THOSE DAYS MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE THE SIGNING EXPERIENCE
2609-157645-0002 SOMETIMES THE TOBACCO USED IN CHURCH WAS DISINFECTANT, NOT DEALING WITH RISING PURPOSES
4198-12281-0007  WHEREFORE IS IT THAT OUR DEVOTIONS WERE INSTITUTED TO BE SHORT IN THE TIME OF HARVEST INVENTAGE AND LONG IN THE ADVENT AND ALL THE WINTER
4198-12281-0012 O THE HOLY LADY KNIGHT SAID ONE THE GOOD SANCTUS O OUR LADY OF SUCCOR SAID ANOTHER HELP HELP
4198-12281-0002 NEVERTHELESS AT ALL VENTURES THEY RANG THE BELLS AT CAPITULUM CAPITULANTIES

4198-12281-0005 LORD GOD THOU ME HE POTUM
4852-28330-0023  NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
533-1066-0003 FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN ORDER
533-1066-0008 THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT
533-1066-0009  SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID
533-1066-0006  I HAVE NONE I SAID HAPPILY
4852-28330-0022  I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0025 THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME OF THE WHILE
533-1066-0000  WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO BE INSTRUCTED AS TO RENEWED VIGILANCE AND THEN AFTER DISTINGUISHING THE WHOLE LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0015 WAS ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT OF PROFANITY FROM DOCTOR STEWART WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
4198-12259-0002  A CESSATION AND TRUCE WITH THIRST
4198-12259-0007  DRINK ALWAYS AND YOU SHALL NEVER DIE
4198-12259-0005 WHICH WAS FIRST THOSE WHO DRINK
3997-182399-0014 BUT HE DOESN'T MIND THAT
4198-12259-0023 BUT IF THERE CAME SUCH LIQUOR FOR MY BALLOT WILL YOU NOT WILLINGLY THEREAFTER SUCK THE UDDER WHENCE IT ISSUED
4198-12259-0022  A LITTLE RAIN ALLAYS A GREAT DEAL OF WIND LONG TIPPLING BREAKS THE THUNDER
4198-12259-0021 IT IS THE COMPULSION OF DRINKERS IT IS A PULLEY
4198-12259-0015  COME LET US DRINK WILL YOU SEND NOTHING TO THE RIVER
4198-12259-0010 IT IS ENOUGH TO BREAK BOTH GUT AND PETROL
4198-12259-0013 OUR FATHERS DRANK LUSTILY AND EMPTIED THEIR CASK
3764-168671-0043  FIRST OF ALL THOUGHT I AM LOST
3764-168671-0042  YOU ARE A PEASANT I AM A PARISIAN

3764-168671-0051  HERE A REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
3764-168671-0049 BUT SO YOU ARE NOT A GRAVEDIGGER THEN
3764-168671-0054  ONE MUST EAT
3997-180294-0007  EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNCIL OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008  THE MORE GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MEN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
2033-164914-0004  BY ALLAH REPLIED THE FIREMAN I TELL THEE THE TRUTH
2033-164914-0005  TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED QUOTH SARAMAKAN
2033-164914-0012  RETURN QUICKLY AND LINGER NOT
1998-29455-0039  WHAT'S THAT THERE SAID DICKY
2033-164915-0004 ACCORDINGLY SHE TOLD HIM ALL THAT HAD COME TO HER SINCE THEIR SEPARATION AT THE KHAN AND WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER WITH THE BEDOUIN HOW THE MERCHANT HAD BOUGHT HER OF HIM AND HAD TAKEN HER TO HER BROTHER SHARKAN AND HAD SOLD HER TO HIM AND HOW HE HAD MADE THEIR MARRIAGE CONTRACT WITH HER
2033-164914-0021 WE WILL DO THEE NO UPRIGHT O MY SON NOR WRONG THEE IN AUGHT BUT OUR OBJECT IS THAT THOU BEND THY GRACIOUS STEPS WITH ME TO MY MISTRESS TO RECEIVE HER ANSWER AND RETURNING WELL AND SAFELY AND THOU SHALT HAVE A HANDSOME PRESENT AS ONE WHO BRINGETH GOOD NEWS
2033-164914-0017 THEN HE KISSED THE EUNUCH'S HEAD AND SPAKE HIM FAIR TILL HE WENT AWAY BUT THE CASTRATO FETCHED AROUND AND RETURNING SECRETLY CAME AND STOOD BEHIND THE FIREMAN FEARING TO GO BACK TO HIS MISTRESS WITHOUT TIDINGS
2033-164914-0022  THEN THE EUNUCH WENT OUT TO ZAUMAKAN AND SAID TO HIM RECITE WHAT VERSES THOU KNOWEST FOR MY LADIES HERE HARD BY LISTENING TO THEE AND AFTER I WILL ASK THEE OF THY NAME AND THY CONDITION
2033-164914-0016  SO GO THOU TO THY STATION AND IF THOU AGAIN MEET ANY ONE AFTER THIS HOUR RECITING AUGHT OF POETRY WHETHER HE BE NEAR OR FAR IT WILL BE I OR SOME ONE I KNOW AND THOU SHALT NOT LEARN OF HIM BUT BY ME
2033-164915-0003  AFTER A WHILE THEY CAME TO THEMSELVES AND NUZHAT AL ZAMAN REJOICED WITH EXCEEDING JOY OPPRESSION AND DEPRESSION LAUGHTER AND GLADNESS TOOK THE MASTERY OF HER AND SHE REPEATED THESE VERSES
4852-28311-0023  BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0014  CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL THEY LOOKED EAGERLY BUT UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28311-0017  A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GREY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING AND HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
4852-28311-0021  THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0025  HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
4852-28311-0024  HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0018  THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CAR HORN WAKING FROM HIS DREAM
3005-163390-0004 EVERYBODY SINGS OUT SOLD
3005-163389-0011  YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL
3005-163390-0002 TWENTY PEOPLE SING OUT
3005-163390-0003  THE DUKE SAYS YES
3005-163390-0015  AND LOOK AT CHARLES SECOND AND LOUIS FOURTEENTH AND LOUIS FIFTEENTH AND JAMES SECOND AND EDWARD SECOND AND RICHARD THIRD AND FORTY MORE BESIDES ALL THEM SAXON HEPTARKIS THAT USED TO RIP AROUND SO IN OLD TIMES AND RAISE CAIN
3005-163390-0009  WE STRUCK THE RAFT AT THE SAME TIME AND IN LESS THAN TWO SECONDS WE WAS GLIDING DOWN STREAM ALL DARK AND STILL AND EDGING TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER NOBODY SAYING A WORD
3005-163390-0014 WELL THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING ALL KINGS IS MOSTLY RATSCALLIONS AS FAR AS I CAN MAKE OUT YOU DAT SO
3005-163390-0007 WHAT WE WANT IS TO GO OUT OF HERE QUIET AND NOT TO SHOW UP AND SELL THE REST OF THE TOWN
3005-163390-0016  MY YOU OUGHT TO SEE IN OLD HENRY THE EIGHT WHEN HE WAS IN BLOOM HE WAS A BLOSSOM
3005-163390-0005 BUT A BIG FINE LOOKING MAN JUMPS UP ON A BENCH AND SHOUTS HOLD ON
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPRIVY'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF-DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032  THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4852-28330-0021  I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICIMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0019 THE CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANYONE ELSE OF HIS TIME HAD UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0007 CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN AS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING
4852-28330-0016  YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY THAT I DO
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNEY WOULD BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
4852-28330-0010  THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0015  THIS SHIP ITS CARGO IN ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
4852-28330-0012  THE SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN MY POOR MOTHER OR FAMILY
4852-28330-0020 WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS OUGHT TO ASK
4350-10919-0002 THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY
4350-10919-0009  YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
4350-10919-0007 AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS OF MILITARY NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO LONG
4350-10919-0003  WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
4350-10919-0006  THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
4350-10919-0010 BEG PARDON IS THE HOUSEKEEPER BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND
4350-10919-0005  AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
4294-9934-0029  AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0011  HE ASKED AH IT IS
533-131562-0013  NOT IN MONEY MATTERS EXACTLY IT SEEMS BUT IS FIRST TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF TEMPTATION
533-131564-0007  NEVER MIND MY PLAIN SPEAKING SAID I IT IS FROM THE BEST OF MOTIVES
533-131562-0016  I TRY TO LOOK TO HIM AND RAISE MY HEART TO HEAVEN BUT IT WILL CLEAVE TO THE DUST
533-131564-0005  WE ALL HAVE A BIT OF A LIKING FOR HIM AT THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS THOUGH WE CAN'T RESPECT HIM
533-131562-0015 I KNOW THAT DAY AFTER DAY SUCH FEELINGS WILL RETURN UPON ME
533-131564-0006  NO I'D RATHER BE LIKE MYSELF THAN AS I AM
533-131564-0002  NO UNLESS YOU CAN TELL ME WHEN TO EXPECT HIM HOME
533-131564-0004 IT IS A RESOLUTION YOU FORMED LONG AGO
533-131562-0011 WHAT GREAT DISCOVERY HAVE YOU MADE NOW MISTER HUNTINGDON
533-131564-0003 I CAN'T IF ONE WANTS HIM TO YOU
4852-28319-0020  THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM
4852-28319-0018  CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
4852-28330-0005 WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STALLS TO TICKLE THERE
4852-28319-0025  IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
4852-28330-0000  THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING DEDED
4852-28330-0009  HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO OUTDO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0018  HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0006  CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0013  AND PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM
4294-9934-0009  IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
4294-35475-0024  AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR
4294-35475-0026  SO THEY ALL CRIED OUT LONG AND LOUD LONG LIVE THE PRINCE PRINCE ZO
4294-9934-0001  HE HAD BUT JUST ACQUIRED A FAITH MUST HE THEN REJECT IT ALREADY
4294-9934-0008  HIS DISCOMFORT WAS AUGMENTED BY ALL THE REFLECTIONS WHICH OCCURRED TO HIM
4294-9934-0004  MARIUS WAS CLEAR EYED AND HE REQUIRED THE TRUE LIGHT
4294-9934-0005  THE HALF LIGHTS OF DOUBT PAINED HIM
4294-35475-0025 BUT ETHELRIED HEEDED NOT THEIR TAUNTS
4294-9934-0015  YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PAIR OF TROUSERS A WAISTCOAT A HAT AND A COAT AND MY BOOTS
4294-9934-0021  HE PAID TWENTY FRANCS FOR THE CAST OFF GARMENTS THEY WENT TO THE WATCHMAKERS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBORING BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030  THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0027  AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THANKS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0052  THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0043 THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0048  SO THAT THIS JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF I HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
4350-9170-0045  I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0056  THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
533-131562-0004 AND PUTTING THE KEYS INTO HIS POCKET HE WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY
533-131556-0021  GIVE ME NO THANKS IT IS NOT FOR YOUR SAKE THAT I REFRAIN
533-131562-0006  MISTER HUNTINGDON THEN WENT UPSTAIRS
533-131556-0025  HOW DARE YOU MENTION HIS NAME TO ME
533-131556-0022 AND MILICENT WILL YOU TELL HER
533-131556-0020  I SHALL NOT TELL HIM
533-131564-0001 MISTER AND MISSUS HATTERSLEY HAVE BEEN STAYING AT GRASSDALE FOR A FORTNIGHT AND AS MISSUS HARGRAVE IS STILL ABSENT AND THE WEATHER WAS REMARKABLY FINE I NEVER PASSED THE DAY WITHOUT SEEING MY TWO FRIENDS MILICENT AND ESTHER EITHER THERE OR HERE
533-131562-0009 I SHALL PUT YOU UPON A SMALL MONTHLY ALLOWANCE IN FUTURE FOR YOUR OWN PRIVATE EXPENSES AND YOU NEEDN'T TROUBLE YOURSELF ANY MORE ABOUT MY CONCERNS I SHALL LOOK OUT FOR A STEWARD MY DEAR I WON'T EXPOSE YOU TO TEMPTATION
533-131562-0014 HERE BASIL ENTERED WITH THE CANDLES AND THERE FOLLOWED A BRIEF INTERVAL OF SILENCE I SITTING STILL IN MY CHAIR AND HE STANDING WITH HIS BACK TO THE FIRE SILENCE IS THE TRYING THING IN MY DESPAIR
533-131562-0010 AND AS FOR THE HOUSEHOLD MATTERS MISSUS GREEVES MUST BE VERY PARTICULAR IN KEEPING HER ACCOUNTS WE MUST GO UPON AN ENTIRELY NEW PLAN
4198-12259-0041  AS YOU SEE MASTER PASSED
4198-12281-0001  I BESEECH YOU THINK UPON IT
4198-12281-0015  IN THE MEANTIME FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVOURED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000  IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF AESHER BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING CHOW DURUS WHO LEAPED FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HARDLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGION OF CAVALRY
4198-12281-0013 SOME DIED WITHOUT SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE WITHOUT DYING SOME DIED IN SPEAKING OTHERS SPOKE AND DIED
4198-61336-0007 THE SHIFTY MET HE ILL YOU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHORDUR WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH IN AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION
4198-61336-0003 TIGLATH BELLISER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE RAṬṬĀNU ARMY IN KOUMAK
4198-61336-0002 WELL MIGHT SHORDURUS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
4198-61336-0012  ITS FORM MAY NOT HAVE BEEN UNCONNECTED WITH THE TREND OF EVINCE IN ASSYRIA DURING THE CLOSING YEARS OF THE MIDDLE EMPIRE
3997-180294-0011  THEY LOVE BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR WRENCH
3997-180294-0005  NOW GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0013  THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF TO GIVE
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH AND SOUL TO RECEIVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONE DROUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0026  AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0029 YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0021  MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TONIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0027  DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKS THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
4350-9170-0005  THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0001  THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTTISH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TODAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0019  GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0021  THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE USE OF AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED STILL LESS AND A LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
3005-163389-0001  SOME SUNG OUT TEAR DOWN THE FENCE TEAR DOWN THE FENCE
2609-169640-0017 THE GIANT BEHAVED BEAUTIFULLY HE CAME ALONG LIKE A PART
2609-169640-0023 AND OUT IF WE TOUCHED AND THEN IN THE NEAREST PRAYER
3005-163389-0002  THE STILLNESS WAS AWFUL CREEPY AND UNCOMFORTABLE
2609-169640-0022 THEY WERE LIKE THE YEARS OF FRIENDS IN LANGUAGE
2609-169640-0020 NOT SO ON BOARD THE JOB WAS HARD
3005-163389-0004  THE AVERAGE MAN'S A COWARD
3005-163389-0007  YOU DIDN'T WANT TO COME
3005-163390-0001 THE PEOPLE MOST KILLED THEMSELVES LAUGHING AND WHEN THE KING GOT DONE CAPERING AND CAPERED OFF BEHIND THE SCENES THEY ROARED AND CLAPPED AND STORMED AND HOW HARD TO TELL HE COME BACK AND DONE IT OVER AGAIN AND AFTER THAT THEY MADE HIM DO ANOTHER TIME
3005-163389-0014  SO THEN A RING MASTER HE MADE A LITTLE SPEECH AND SAID HE HOPED THERE WOULDN'T BE NO DISTURBANCE AND IF THE MAN WOULD PROMISE HE WOULDN'T MAKE NO MORE TROUBLE HE WOULD LET HIM RIDE IF HE THOUGHT HE COULD STAY ON THE HORSE
3080-5032-0018  WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMANS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL
3080-5032-0019  THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN IT UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONESELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0015  I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHEN MY AUNT AND SUCH HAS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME MY DEAR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0012  BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013  I HAVE MISSED FOUR FITS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0024  AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNED IT SINCE
3080-5032-0022  I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS YET MOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM'S CHEEK MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETER'S
3080-5032-0021  HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0017  IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS ESCAPE IT
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS, DESTROYED ORCHARDS, AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT TO THE SWORD WITH ALL THE LIVESTOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ON
4198-61336-0019  THUS WAS HERETO CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGE AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0021 MENAHEM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PECAHIAH
4198-61336-0017 TAKE LAST POLICEER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIAN AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTHEAST
4198-61336-0022  JUDAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0013  JEHOASH THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SHALLUM
4198-61336-0028 THE PHILISTINES AND THE ARABIANS OF THE DESERT WERE ALSO SUBDUED
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TIGLATH-PILESER RETURNED TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0015 THIS USURPER HELD SWAY AT SAMARIA FOR ONLY A MONTH
3997-182399-0004 PLEASE MISTER WIZARD PLEASE TELL US THE STORY HE BEGGED
3997-182399-0012  IT WAS ON THE LOWER OLD HOUSE A LITTLE OLD TUMBLEDOWN HOUSE
3997-180297-0030  ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANTS MORE THAN THAT WHAT THEN
3997-180297-0031  I EMBRACED MARGUERITE UNTIL SHE WAS ALMOST STIFLED
3997-182399-0009  EVERYBODY LOOKED AT PETER AND LAUGHED
3997-182399-0000 ALL MUST HAVE BUZZARD GRINNED
3997-182399-0003  ANYWAY HE WOULD FIND OUT
3997-182399-0001  THIS SOUNDED LIKE ANOTHER STORY
4198-12259-0008 IF I DRINK NOT I AM A GROUND DRY GRAVELLED AND SPENT I AM STARK DEAD WITHOUT DRINK AND MY SOUL READY TO FLY INTO SOME MARS A MONTH'S FROGS THE SOUL NEVER DWELLS IN A DRY PLACE DRAUGHT KILL IT
4198-12259-0001 SO MY FRIEND SO WHIP ME OFF THIS GLASS NEATLY BRING ME HITHER SOME CLARET A FULL WEEPING GLASS TILL IT RUN OVER
4350-9170-0006  THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-10919-0031  FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-9170-0000  EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-10919-0030  BUT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM BEFORE I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0033  THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0007  THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTED THE ARMY
4350-9170-0004  THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-10919-0032  IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
4350-9170-0008  THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0016  AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
4350-9170-0018  INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0015  IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE IN CONQUEST
4350-9170-0011  ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0017  BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0010  INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0022  SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0033  THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS HAS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4294-14317-0016  AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE NEW SCULPTOR
4294-32859-0000  WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGH'D HIM TO SCORN THOUGH A SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-14317-0018  HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACHED MY HOME
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDERLIN AND WRETCHED PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003  SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED ON HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN IN THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUIDE TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0011  HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0008  IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILMY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0005  I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHELRIED HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
3764-168671-0002  A MORNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIEST AS HE PRAYS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168671-0003  BEHIND IT CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168670-0050  BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0054 THERE HE HALTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN TIE A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0056  ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT WITH GRACE
3764-168671-0006  DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT
3764-168670-0057  THAT IS SETTLED FATHER FAUCHELEVOT ALL WILL GO WELL
3764-168670-0053  I SHALL FOLLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS
4852-28312-0027 A COURTYARD WAS FIRSTLY LIT BY FLARING TORCHES SHOWING THE SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON THE POST
4852-28312-0024 FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0022  IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0001 HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE HE GOT SIMON GOSTLER HIS HOARD OF MONEY IN HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28312-0029 THE COACHMAN HAD STOPPED PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAGGED COURTYARD
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS A PAR FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF IT WAS NOW ABROAD IN MUDDY ROAD
4852-28312-0025  NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLET STREETS
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE FREEWAY
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
3997-180297-0016  WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0029  HE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE HIM
3997-182399-0006 WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN GRANDPA BUZZARD HAD HIS LITTLE FALLING OUT WITH OLD KING EAGLE AND DONE FLIES SO HIGH HE SCORCHED THE FEATHERS OFF IN HIS HEAD HE HAD A COUSIN DID GRANDPA BUZZARD AND THIS COUSIN WAS JUST NATURALLY LAZY AND NO COUNT
3997-182399-0008 WASN'T ANYTHING GOING ON THAT THIS TRIFLING MEMBER OF THE BUZZARD FAMILY DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT AND MEDDLE IN HE COULD ASK MORE QUESTIONS THAN PETER RABBIT CAN AND ANYBODY THAT CAN DO THAT HAS GOT TO ASK A LOT
3997-182399-0005  NOW ALL MISTER BUZZARD IS NATURALLY GOOD NATURED AND ACCOMMODATING AND WHEN PETER BAGGED SO HARD HE JUST COULDN'T FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO REFUSE
3997-182399-0007 LIKE MOST NO COUNT PEOPLE HE USED TO MAKE A REGULAR NUISANCE OF HIMSELF POKING HIS NOSE INTO EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS AND NEVER TENDING TO HIS OWN
3997-182399-0010 SO WE'LL SET ON THE CHIMNEY TOPS WHENEVER OLD JACK FROST GETS TO STRAYING DOWN WHERE HE HAVE NO BUSINESS
3997-182399-0013  WHY HE JUST STRETCH HIS FULL HEAD AS FAR DOWN THE CHIMNEY AS HE CAN AND LISTEN AND LISTEN
3997-182399-0011 ONE DAY THIS NO COUNT'S TRIFLING COUSIN OF GRANDPA BUZZARD GET COLD FEET
3997-182399-0002  HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HEADED COUSIN OF ALL MISTER BUZZARD VERY CURIOUS INDEED
4294-9934-0022  HE BOUGHT THE WATCH FOR FORTY FIVE FRANCS
4294-9934-0025  I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0020  THE CLOTHES DEALER WAS SENT FOR
4294-9934-0016  THAT WILL BE ENOUGH
4294-9934-0028  MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH THE RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
4294-9934-0027  ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOL THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD AND A SEALED BOX
4350-10919-0008 THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOSIS THIS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
4294-9934-0026 THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
4350-10919-0004 IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LOOKS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
4350-10919-0000  HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
3764-168671-0031  BUT YOU'RE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
3764-168671-0033  THE MAN REPLIED
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MESCAN'S TURN FATHER MESCAN DIED
3764-168671-0048  BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0052 FAUCHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS AND RETARDED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0044  THEY WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUN'S CORNER
3764-168671-0045  AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0050  RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRYTANEUM TOMHON
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0025  MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND HANDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID
3997-180297-0015  WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0022  WHAT I LOVED IN YOU WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0028  LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID MARGUERITE
3997-180297-0027 I TORE A LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME
3997-180297-0021  I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIVES WHICH HE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0017 WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF-ESTEEMED LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DID HE GIVE YE ADVICE WHICH IS NOT LUCRATIVE
3997-180297-0026  HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
3538-163622-0016  YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID CINDER LAD
3538-163622-0014  AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED FULL SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID CINDER LAD
3538-163622-0017  IT LOOKS LIKE THE CHALK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED THE LAD
3538-163624-0011  THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0003  SO ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0018 THERE SIGURD ROASTING FAFNIR'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
4198-61336-0023  HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITS IDOLATRIES AND CRIED
4198-61336-0027  HE SWEPT THROUGH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0025  THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINES SHALL PERISH
4198-61336-0026  ISRAEL WAS ALSO DEALT WITH
4294-14317-0009  I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO AMVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMEN GEORGIO DECK COURTONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0004  BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BEND NELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP AND CLEAN I SAID AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0012  WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDONIA WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE AND ANTONI LANDY WITH HIM
4198-61336-0030 THE KINDER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITAL SHEPHERD WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0007  I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAVOUR TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4852-28311-0020  AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0013 AH SHUCKS
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY DO YOU NOT SEE THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CURVE OF WALL OUTER STREET NOT THE HILL TOWARD THE DISTANT SIGNALS
4852-28312-0006  LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WITH THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH-CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0005  THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0002  WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0004  MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE GIBBS GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0015  HE GUESSED THERE IT MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
4294-14317-0014  I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE GALISANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES OF FRANCE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCE
4294-32859-0001  IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0004  HE ASSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-14317-0017  NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-35475-0001 ROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND A STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0003  IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN SIZE AND COURAGE IT SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-32859-0005  BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0004  FORTHWITH THE GRINNING GESTURE BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-14317-0015  AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIERRE WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SON WAS LITTLE IN LORN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4852-28312-0019  THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28319-0000  THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
4852-28312-0018  THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0023  THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOW WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BESIDE
4852-28319-0016  HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOOD AND FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU'VE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW AS GOOD A TIME FOR YOU TO TRY THIS AS ANY
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE CURVED UP POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0010  HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
533-131556-0011 IF I WERE SUSPICIOUS I REPLIED I SHOULD HAVE DISCOVERED YOUR INFAMY LONG BEFORE
533-131556-0018  I CANNOT RENOUNCE THAT IS DEARER THAN LIFE SHE MUTTERED IN A LOW HURRIED TONE
533-131556-0017 SHE PAUSED IN EVIDENT DISCONCERTION AND PERPLEXITY MINGLED WITH ANGER SHE DARED NOT SHOW
533-131556-0008 IT MAY GO MILLICENT UNTIL FOLLOW IN A WHILE MILLICENT WENT
533-131556-0007 UP AND BRUISING THIS SHE TURNED SCARLET AND BIT HER LIP
533-131556-0009  WILL YOU OBLIGE ME ELLEN CONTINUED SHE
533-131556-0004  I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECORD HIM SO MINUTELY
533-131556-0010  HA YOU ARE SUSPICIOUS
533-131556-0015  YES YES
533-131556-0016  SUPPOSE I DO
4350-10919-0025  EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026  THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0019 OH TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0027  THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT, HE ADDED
4350-10919-0012  OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-9170-0009  POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS, AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN, THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-9170-0002  IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003  THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4852-28311-0009  HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN M STREET
4350-9170-0060  FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESS HER
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTIALLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0007  CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0001  CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JACK AND SPARK PLUG
4350-9170-0058  TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4852-28311-0002 NO ONE NEEDS A JOB BUT THAT'S JAKIE HARRIS
4852-28311-0011  A BIT YER AND GOIN AFTER ALL IT IS TURNED TO IN HIM
4198-12259-0009  HE DRINKS IN VAIN THAT FILLS NOT THE PLEASURE OF IT
4198-12259-0011  WHAT DIFFERENCE IS THIS BETWEEN A BOTTLE AND A FLAGON
4198-12259-0020 GIVE ME A SYNONYM FOR A GAMMON OF BACON
4198-12259-0019 AND I SICUT TERRA IN AQUA
4198-12259-0012  GRAVELY AND WELL PLAYED UPON THE WORDS
4198-12259-0018 AND I TAME CALM RESPONSES
4198-12259-0014 WELL CACKLED WELL SUNG
4198-12259-0016 I DRANK NO MORE THAN HIS SPANS
4198-12259-0017 I DRINK LIKE A TEMPLAR KNIGHT
4198-12259-0024 HERE, PAGE PHIL
4198-61336-0009  FOR THREE YEARS HE CONDUCTED VIGOROUS CAMPAIGNS IN THE WESTERN LAND WHERE HE MEANT WITH VIGOROUS RESISTANCE
4198-61336-0004  A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF HIS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST URTO, ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0001  AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0010 OUR PAD WAS CAPTURED AND MET TO BE DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE HEBREWS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH SYRIA
4198-12281-0014  CAN YOU TELL WITH WHAT INSTRUMENTS THEY DID IT
4198-61336-0008 THE LAST BELIEVER HAD THEREFORE TO MARCH WESTWARD AGAIN
4198-61336-0024 FOR THUS SAITH THE LORD UNTO THE HOUSE OF ISRAEL, SEEK YE ME AND YE SHALL LIVE. HAVE YE OFFER'D UNTO ME SACRIFICES AND OFFERINGS IN THE WILDERNESS FORTY YEARS, O HOUSE OF ISRAEL?
4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MANY HIM, THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4294-35475-0018  IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0020  WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT
4294-35475-0022  WE GRAND DAME WHOM HE SUPPLIED WITH FAGOTS THE MERCHANT WHOM HE RESCUED FROM ROBBERS THE KING'S COUNSELLOR TO WHOM HE GAVE AID ALL BECAME HIS FRIENDS UP AND DOWN THE LAND BEGGAR OR LORD HOMELESS WANDERER OR HIGH BORN DAME HE GLADLY GAVE UNSELFISH SERVICE ALL UNSOUGHT AND SUCH AS HE HELPED STRAIGHTWAY BECAME HIS FRIENDS
4294-9934-0000  HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVED LATER
4294-35475-0023  TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-9934-0003  TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0006  WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0002  HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-35475-0021  MY GRAIN MUST FALL AND ROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-9934-0007  HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4852-28319-0019  HE HEARD THAT MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REELLY EMPTY WITH SO DOOM'S PROPER SHAPE AND OPEN THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES WEDDING FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WICKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOOR BOARDS CREAKED QUICKLY AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE FORTUNE FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED THAT THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28319-0024  WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOORS SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHT BEFORE REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD BIT OF IT IN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO WHAT KEEP MY EYES OPEN
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NED SILLEY WAS RELIEVED TO THE HELM BY ALBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0001  GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28319-0021  THUS CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022  CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME
4852-28330-0017  CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN ITS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0014  WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
533-1066-0002 I'M SURE I KISSED LUCY AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMESON TOO WITH THE EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED A THOUSAND MILES IN THE BOXCAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISS EANES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UPSTAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TONIGHT
533-1066-0007  I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
533-1066-0011  LIDDY WAS SLEEPING SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OF ALL OUR CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
4852-28330-0024  HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOW SURELY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0006  IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGS TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO BE HEARD THE LABORERS IN THE FIELDS WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0010  WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0000  THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE
3997-180294-0002  WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASKED FOR SOMETHING WHAT
3997-180294-0015 THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WITH THEIR LOVE SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0004  I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
4294-9934-0024  THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
4294-9934-0011  REQUEST COURFEYRAC TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0017  NO IT IS NOT GOOD WHAT WILL YOU DO AFTER THAT
4294-9934-0019  IT IS BADLY PAID WORK BUT ONE CAN LIVE BY IT
4294-9934-0023  HELLO I HAD FORGOTTEN THAT SAID MARIUS
4294-9934-0012  WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COURFEYRAC
4294-9934-0014  SILVER GOLD HERE IT IS
4294-9934-0013  WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
4294-9934-0018  DO YOU KNOW GERMAN NO
4294-9934-0010 THEY SOON ELBOWED HIM ABRUPTLY
4350-9170-0055  AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0047  WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION, EDUCATION, CULTURE, MEANS OF COMMUNICATION, AND SO ON
4350-9170-0046  EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0054  THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0050  WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0042  GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0051  THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0053  WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0044  AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
3997-182399-0018 WHEN HE GOT HOME HE TRIED AND TRIED TO BRUSH THE SUIT OFF BUT IT HAD GOTTEN INTO THE SKIN AND IT STAYED THERE
4198-12259-0004  BY THE BELLY OF SAINT BUFF LET US TALK OF OUR DRINK I NEVER DRINK BUT AT MY HOURS LIKE THE POPE'S MULE
3997-182399-0015  WELL YOU ALL PLEASE SPEAK A LITTLE LOUDER HE HOLLERED DOWN THE CHIMNEY JUST LIKE THAT
4198-12259-0000 DRAW WHEAT FLOUR MIX GIVE IT TO ME WITHOUT WATER
3997-182399-0019  A LITTLE SIGH OF SATISFACTION WENT ROUND THE CIRCLE OF LISTENERS
3997-182399-0020  IT WAS JUST AS GOOD AS ONE OF GRANDFATHER FROGS
4198-12259-0006 WHAT IT SEEMS I DO NOT DRINK BUT BY AN ATTORNEY'S
4198-12259-0003 YOU HAVE CAST A COLD GLAMOUR YEA FORSOOTH SIR
3997-182399-0017 THEY LIKED TO CHOKE THAT NEW COMPOSER TO DEATH
3997-182399-0016 YES SIR SHE SURELY WAS PLUMB SCARED

3764-168671-0012  IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTERMEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE VOYAGER IT HINTED AT POVERTY PATHOLOGIES IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PARALLELASHES IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0021  HE WAS A SORT OF LABORING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0011  THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3764-168671-0016  JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLITIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0015  FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0013  MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
3764-168671-0019  HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
533-131562-0000 IT SEEMS A VERY INTERESTING NOVEL SAID HE LIFTING HIS HEAD AND TURNING TO WHERE I STOOD WRINGING MY HAND IN SILENT RAGE AND ANGUISH BUT IT'S RATHER LONG I'LL LOOK AT IT SOME OTHER TIME AND MEANWHILE I'LL TROUBLE YOU FOR YOUR KEYS MY DEAR WHAT CASE

533-131562-0001 IT IS A KISS OF YOUR CABINET DESK DRAWER AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU POSSESS SAID HE RISING AND HOLDING OUT HIS HAND
533-131562-0002 THE KEY OF MY DESK IN FACT WAS AT THAT MOMENT IN LAW AND THE OTHERS WERE ATTACHED TO IT
533-131562-0003  NOW THEN SNEERED HE WE MUST HAVE A CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY
533-131562-0005 THAT AND ALL REPLIED MESSER AND THINGS WERE CLEARED AWAY
533-131556-0023 I WILL NOT FOR MUCH THAT YOU SHOULD NOT EVEN BE IN DISGRACE OF RELATION
533-131562-0007 MUTTERED HE STARTING BACK SHE'S A VERY DEVIL FOR SPITE
533-131562-0008 I DIDN'T SAY I'D BROKEN IT DID I RETURNED HE
533-131556-0024  YOU USE OUR WORDS MISSUS HUNTINGDON BUT I CAN PARDON YOU
4852-28319-0008 NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WICKER SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0002 CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF AND ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0007  MISTER WICKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0015  IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0012  SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE THE RETURN
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CATCH IT BACK
4852-28319-0009  A SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
4852-28319-0017  BUT HOW DID ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
4852-28319-0014  THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHOULD I DO FIRST
3764-168671-0014  A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPLE
3764-168671-0022  THE MAN REPLIED THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0020  THE PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
3764-168671-0010  IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY
3764-168671-0017  WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESSIAEN
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER, HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY, FATHER MESSIAEN IS THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0026 FAUCHELEVENT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS, BUT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE
3764-168671-0025 FATHER MESSIAEN IS THE GRAVE DIGGER HE WAS
6070-63485-0005 NO SAID THE OLD BRUTE GRUMBLINGLY NO NOT ONE RING MUCH ASHAMED
6070-63485-0016 BETWEEN SAINT JUIR AND THE ROAD OF LA REVOLT AT THE END OF THE ROAD AGREED
6070-63485-0008  THEN ADDRESSING THOMAS SEATAN YOU KNOW THE PLAIN OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0007  O AH TO LAY A TRAP TO CATCH US REPLIED THE THIEF
6070-63485-0011 VETCH I DO NOT SEEK HIS LIFE REPLIED SARAH TO THE SCHOOLMASTER
6070-63485-0010  CRIED THE SCHOOLMASTER A THOUSAND FRANCS AND I'LL KILL HIM
6070-63485-0017  HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE ADDRESS OF THE SELF STYLED FAN PAINTER
6070-63485-0013 ALL BUT IT WILL PAY FOR LOOKING AFTER
6070-63485-0015  IN THE PLANE OF SAINT DENIS
6070-63485-0012  LET'S GO AND MEET HIM
5484-24318-0001  TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMANN PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS ROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WERE STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24318-0008  BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS BERTALUS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNARES ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0030  ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ANTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMOND'S REGARD
5484-24318-0007  IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMAND WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AN ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24318-0009  THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24317-0028  YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24318-0003  WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS A LOT OF BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0017  A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY EIGHT AGAINST
5442-41168-0023  IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE
5442-41168-0018 SANG OUT THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0020  BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED
5442-41168-0014  SOLDIER IVANOVITCH FROWNED
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEI IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST VICKERS VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRIES UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTABLE FLOURISH TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMEN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0007  OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WHERE THEN DO YOU THE THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0021  BESIDES I LIVED DIDN'T WANT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0019  AND MISSUS LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0013  SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATTER
6128-63240-0022  THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH ALL LIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
6128-63240-0016  SHE HATES IT SHE WILL LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0020  ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR
6128-63240-0015  NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE
6128-63240-0014  HAVE YOU BEEN IN EUROPE
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMONGST THE LEIGE CHRYSIPPUS IN THE ADMIRABLE PROGRESS
5484-24317-0025  THE A ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0015  HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LISMECHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED AUSTINO IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021  HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE-LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK-PROMISING FOUR-LEAVED ONE
5484-24317-0016  THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0022  WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023  THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMON
5484-24317-0026 HER MAMMA LISTENED TO THE PARENTS' SILENCE
6432-63723-0025 TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED: MONEY
6432-63723-0023  IN A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
6432-63723-0020  IT HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
6432-63723-0022  LARCH HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
6432-63723-0017  AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP
6432-63723-0018  STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
6432-63723-0013  BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DEFENCE
6432-63723-0026  AND IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE
6432-63723-0029 THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
6432-63723-0030 BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMARTED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
5442-32873-0007 WHEN HE CAME BACK TO THE DRAWING ROOM, A TATTERED BOTTLE OF EAU DE COLOGNE IN HIS HAND, WITH HER LACE HANDKERCHIEF, HE BATHED HER TEMPLES AND FOREHEAD
5442-32873-0001 THERE WAS A VERY NATURAL SAVAGERY AND DEJECTION THERE, AND A WILD LOOK IN HIS YELLOW EYES. RACHEL SAT DOWN
5442-32873-0008 THERE WAS NOTHING VERY BROTHERLY IN HIS LOOK AS HE PEERED INTO HER PALE, SHARP FEATURES DURING THE PROCESS
5442-32873-0010 AND SHE THREW BACK HER VEIL AND, GOING HURRIEDLY TO THE TOILET, MECHANICALLY SURVEYED HERSELF IN THE GLASS
533-131564-0025  CRIED SHE I COULDN'T HAVE INFLUENCED HIM I'M SURE BY ANYTHING THAT I COULD HAVE SAID
5442-32873-0005 STANLEY, STANLEY, IT WOULD BE MERCY TO KILL ME, SHE BROKE DOWN AGAIN
533-131564-0024 MELLICENT FLEW TO THANK ME, OVERWHELMING IN HIS GRATITUDE
533-131564-0026  YOU NEVER TRIED ME MERELY SAID HE
5442-32873-0011  RACHEL LAKE LADY LAKE WHAT ARE YOU NOW
5442-32873-0000  CAPTAIN LAKE DID NOT LOOK AT ALL LIKE LONDON DANDY NOW
5442-41169-0024  YOUR MERIT I HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO TELL THE CHILD THEIR OWN INTEREST
5442-41169-0026  THE LAND OWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MOUSTACHES
5442-41169-0016  WELL AND HOW IS YOUR LAND DOING
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR BOXES FOR TIMBER
5442-41169-0022  TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THE LIBRARY
5442-41169-0017  BUT ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0025  YES IT'S RATHER STRANGE HE WENT ON
5484-24317-0001 BUT HARMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVELRY AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRAINER
5484-24317-0009  HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED AN IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
5764-299665-0019  CAN WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURED FOR EVER
5764-299665-0010 DID HE ALLOW TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0005  ARE THE FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0018  CAN WE SAY THAT HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
5764-299665-0020 DO WE PROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED A THOUSAND OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0032  IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD SHOWN BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPED IT WITH HIS DIMPLED HAND
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER WHICH THAT WORK FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAD TAUGHT THE CHILD A LESSON
5764-299665-0022 ALL THE SUPERIOR RACE OUGHT TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
5764-299665-0026  MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES THROUGH EXPERIENCE
6432-63722-0006 KARL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE CURL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE
6128-63244-0019  THEY WERE HER SISTERS THEY WERE HER OWN AND THE DAY OF THEIR DELIVERY HAD DAWNED
6432-63722-0002  I'M GOIN OFF FISHIN I MAY NOT CATCH ANYTHING AND MAY NOT WANT TO AFTER I GET THERE
6432-63722-0000 BUT EXCUSE ME THEN YOU'LL FIG ON DOIN SOME DETECTIVE IN GIVING UP FISHIN'T
6432-63722-0008  BUT HE HADN'T ANY MORE TO DO WITH IT COLONEL THAN THAT CAT
6432-63722-0005 PICKED UP AND DOWN OF IT HAVEN'T THEY CARROLL YEP
6432-63722-0003  GET READY SHAG YES A COLONEL
6432-63722-0007  ARE YOU GOING TO WORK ON THAT CASE COLONEL
6432-63722-0018  AND THE DETECTIVE'S PROFESSIONAL INSTINCTS GOT THE UPPER HAND OF HIS FRIENDLINESS NOT THE LEAST IN THE WORLD NOT AS MUCH AS YOU DO WAS THE COOL ANSWER
6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGER FUTZ SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
5764-299665-0094  THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0093  THESE CANNOT BE DONE BY TALK OR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE REFORMS FAILED
5764-299665-0095 THIS FREES WOMEN
6070-63485-0003  SARAH AND HER BROTHER HAVING AGAIN PASSED BY THE TAPPY FROG ARRIVED CLOSE TO THE DILAPIDATED HOUSE WHICH WAS PARTLY IN RUINS AND ITS OPEN CELLARS FORMED A KIND OF GULF ALONG WHICH THE STREET RAN IN THAT DIRECTION
6070-63485-0004 IN AN INSTANT THE SCHOOLMASTER WITH A LEAP RESEMBLING IN STRENGTH AND AGILITY THE SPRING OF A TIGER SEIZED SEATON WITH ONE HAND BY THE THROAT AND EXCLAIMED YOUR MONEY OR I WILL FLING HIM INTO THIS HALL
6070-63485-0002  BY MEANS OF THIS STRATEGEM THEY FOLLOWED SO CLOSELY THAT ALTHOUGH WITHIN A FEW STEPS OF SEREN TOM THEY DID NOT HEAR THEM
6070-63485-0006  TOM SEATON DID NOT LOSE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND DURING THIS SCENE RAPIDLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY AS IT HAD OCCURRED
6070-63485-0009 DID YOU SEE IN THE CABARET WE HAVE JUST LEFT FOR I KNOW YOU AGAIN THE MAN WHOM THE CHARCOAL MAN CAME TO SEEK
6070-63485-0014  WELL MY WIFE SHALL BE THERE SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER YOU WILL TELL HER WHAT YOU WANT AND I SHALL SEE
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SIR IVANOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THIS SYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET IT TO THE MARSHAL IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF WORDS THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF WORDS IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FLORA'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0021  IN REPLY SNOTKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE EFFECT THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE THRUST IT THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DECISION ABOVE FLAROFF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED HIS SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS DURED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
5442-41168-0010  BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0011  TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT BAR
5442-41168-0015  THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN POSITION HE SAID SEVERELY
5484-24318-0016  DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIP HAD SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0014  CRIED HERMANN IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOW THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0011  AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMANN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TOMORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAPHNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTLE'S
5484-24318-0015 TOMORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0018  IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0025 AND I FOOL BLINDED ALL SORTS IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0021  DAPHNE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IS NEEDED
5484-24318-0024  WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
6128-63244-0005 THOSE SORTS OF INFERIOR PEOPLE IF THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FARRINDER WHO LIVED AT BRUXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0004 ALL YOU HATED DEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WITH A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THAT WE FEEL AS WE'RE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0007  SHE WISHED TO ACT IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0015 SAID BOLIF CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSION OF RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WE'RE PREPARED TO TAKE SENSIBLE STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING
6128-63244-0010  ON THE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS BENDER WOULD TREAT THEIR BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
6128-63244-0012 OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL IT WILL BE ALSO FOR THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
6128-63244-0013 BRINGS DESCENDED AMONG THEM AND BRING ME YOUR THOUSAND NAMES
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SENT TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BAZIL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS CAST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTE INFLAMMATION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BAISER RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNA'S SISTER
6128-63241-0010  SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFE AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0004  SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0005  HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF ASCERTAINING HER SUCH SUFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0003  HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF, CHILDREN THAT ARE A BURDEN AND CURSES, WHY
6070-63485-0001  THE TWO MONSTERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES
5764-299665-0088  NATURE PRODUCETH WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0092  LAW CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0086 THEY LIVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND A LOT ON LUCK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0087  FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE WHY
5764-299665-0089  MUST THE WORLD FOREVER REMAIN THE VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0091  PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEAF
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE ENDLESS
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE HAVE BEEN TRACED
5764-299665-0079  WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0077  THAT WHICH HATH NOT HAPPENED COULD NOT
5764-299665-0069  IF WE BUILD WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0075  I SAY WHAT I THINK
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PATHS THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELLED
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE A BASEMENT
5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVENT HAS PARENTS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FAULTS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FACE THE FUTURE WITH A MIND
6070-63485-0000 THERE DONE FOR SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN THE LOKI TO THE SCHWETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE
6128-63240-0004  HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
6128-63240-0007  THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0000  THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN HIS PAGES
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HAIR AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPERS AND ROARING MIRACLES
6128-63240-0009  AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SOWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER A WEARY ASPECT
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MY DEAR
6070-86745-0019  WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
5764-299665-0008  IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE TIME SCREW AND TRACK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0017  LIPS RELIGIOUS AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0004  WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT WAR HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANGED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0006 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0011  CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
5764-299665-0016  FEAR ERECTS THE CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0009 DID THEY BEG THE LORD THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WHERE LIFE FEEDS ON LIFE
5764-299665-0015  FEAR BEATS THE ALTAR AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE
6070-86744-0010 FOR FRANCE NO FOR VENICE I SHALL REMAIN IN ITALY FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO
6070-86744-0009  THAT DEPENDS WHEN DO YOU LEAVE
6070-63485-0018  THE FIACRE STARTED
6070-86744-0011  THEN WE SHALL NOT MEET IN PARIS
6070-86744-0012  I FEAR I SHALL NOT HAVE THAT HONOR
6070-86744-0003  I CAN SCARCELY CREDIT IT
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY ON THE ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HE HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS. HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER, THE HASHISH, THE STATUES, THE DREAM, AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE DREAM
6070-86744-0022 TALKING OF COUNTRIES, REPLIED FRANZ, OF WHAT COUNTRY IS THE COUNT? WHAT IS HIS NATIVE LAND? WHENCE DOES HE DERIVE HIS IMMENSE FORTUNE, AND WHAT WERE THOSE EVENTS OF HIS EARLY LIFE, A LIFE AS MARVELLOUS AS UNKNOWN, THAT HAVE TINTED HIS SUCCEEDING YEARS WITH SO DARK AND GLOOMY A MISANTHROPY?
6070-86744-0019  THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLISSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDED PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86745-0000 THEN SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION, ALBERT DE MORCERF COULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSE TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86745-0016  IN THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0014  BESIDES THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE HOME BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0009  NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW DO NOT CONFOUND OUR PLANS
6070-86745-0011  IT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU SEE ME SO EARLY
6070-86745-0004  VERY WELL AT HALF PAST TEN
6070-86745-0015  ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE PAPERS
6070-86745-0005  IS THE COUNTESS UP YET
6070-86745-0006 THE VALET LEFT THE ROOM
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANTS AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ELLISIONS AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASS IN TONE SOMETHING
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASIL MANSON WENT DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS FETIA IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND, SOULLESS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK, HERMAN
5484-24318-0028  HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0033  HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST DUE
5484-24318-0027  SARKIIS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5764-299665-0002 WHETHER A PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED
5764-299665-0001  WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MYSELF
5764-299665-0003  WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR
5484-24318-0031  ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBBED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5764-299665-0007  IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH A LASH FOR THE BABE THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WISDOM INTENTIONALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPTIC NERVES THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SIGNOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND CONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN
6070-86744-0024 MY DEAR FRANZ REPLIED ALBERT WHEN UPON RECEIPT OF MY LETTER YOU FOUND THE NECESSITY OF ASKING THE COUNT'S ASSISTANCE YOU PROMPTLY WENT TO HIM SAYING MY FRIEND ALBERT DE MORCERF IS IN DANGER HELP ME TO DELIVER HIM
6070-86744-0015  I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT REPLIED FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED TOO THAT CONTRARY TO THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE
6070-86744-0028  WELL SAID FRANZ WITH A SIGH DO AS YOU PLEASE MY DEAR VISCOUNT FOR YOUR ARGUMENTS ARE BEYOND MY POWERS OF REFUTATION
6070-86744-0025 WHAT ARE HIS MEANS OF EXISTENCE WHAT IS HIS BIRTHPLACE OF WHAT COUNTRY IS HE A NATIVE
6070-86744-0020  BUT SAID FRANZ THE CORSICAN BANDITS THAT WERE AMONG THE CREW OF HIS VESSEL
6070-86744-0023  CERTAINLY THESE ARE QUESTIONS THAT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE ANSWERED
6070-86744-0029  AND NOW MY DEAR FRANZ LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
6070-86744-0021 WHY REALLY THE THING SEEMS TO ME SIMPLE ENOUGH
5484-24317-0003  SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION
5442-41169-0028  SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A RETURN TO ADD A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0012  TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT AS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0027 THE RODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSINOE ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTOR'S ART WHEN CRATES HERMANN'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMETER WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES ENQUIRE WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HEPHAESTUS AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0014 CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSINOE'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSINOE HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYES HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
5484-24317-0013  A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELL CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVED THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR A BALLOT
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NEAR CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARTIAN HE'S NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGER HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TAMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TAMAR
5442-41168-0000  THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
5442-32873-0012  I'LL STAY HERE THAT IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-41168-0007  THEY EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE BASIN
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME AND I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CRUMB
5442-41168-0004  WE SHED OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
6128-63240-0001  THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0012  HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUNA WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6070-86745-0018  COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIA
6128-63240-0002 SHE IS WILLING TO REST THAT
6128-63240-0024  HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNAR'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AND MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63241-0000  POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BOEOTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63240-0025  HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE CALLED AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LUNA'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANCELLOR THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LUNA
6128-63244-0016  I WANT TO BE NEAR TO THEM TO HELP THEM
6128-63244-0018  THE UNHAPPINESS OF WOMEN
6128-63244-0020 THIS WAS THE ONLY SACRED CAUSE THIS WAS THE GREAT THE DUST REVELATION IT WAS TRIUMPH IT WAS SWEETER WITHIN BEFORE IT IT MUST EXACT FROM THE OTHER THE BRUTAL BUT STAINED RAVENING RACE THE LAST PARTICLE OF EXPIATION
6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW A MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MISTURBATION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY AS SUCCESS
6432-63722-0004  AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN THE CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WHO INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTED IN EVERY PULSE OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0024 OLIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG AND REWARDED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OF AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BIRD'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HER COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLE HUMANITARIAN HACK SIMPLE READY A MATTER
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
6938-70848-0024 HE KNEW THAT AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI WAS BEING DISCUSSED BUT HE DID NOT KNOW THAT IT HAD BEEN CONCLUDED
7018-75788-0002  HEARING THIS I WAS SORE TROUBLED REMEMBERING WHAT I HAD BEFORE SUFFERED FROM THE APE KIND
7018-75788-0001  BEHOLD A SHIP WAS MAKING FOR THE ISLAND THROUGH THE DASHING SEA AND CLASHING WAVES
6938-70848-0027  BUT THE PRESENT MOMENT IS INTERNATIONAL AND THAT IS WHY IT IS INVINCIBLE
6938-70848-0021 FOLLOWING HIM, LENIN LISTENED NOW WITH ABSORBING INTENSITY
6938-70848-0020 THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY WILL NOT DARE TO BREAK WITH THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE
6938-70848-0028 THE WILL OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IS NOW CONCENTRATED IN THE HALL
6938-70848-0030 I GREET YOU WITH THE CHRISTENING OF A NEW RUSSIAN LIFE AND FREEDOM
6938-70848-0029  A NEW HUMANITY WILL BE BORN OF THIS WAR
6938-70848-0023 THE DUMAS AND THEMSELVES WERE DROPPED
5484-24318-0020  I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0010  YET IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FESTAL PERFORMANCES. EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT, HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WILDLY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER, RICHLY GARLANDED, THEIR CHIEFS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN, LAMBS, AND DOVES, AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR ON ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES, THE GODS GAVE RAIN, SUNSHINE, AND HARVEST
5484-24318-0029  HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMENES THE RHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLAS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0036  EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMETER HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WHEN THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE. CONCEAL AND PALLIATE NOTHING
5484-24318-0037 HONOUR TO MYRTILUS AND HIS ART, BUT HE TRUSTED THE NOBLE FESTAL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5484-24318-0032 EVEN AFTER THIS IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM WAS SEATED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0030  BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
533-131564-0013  NOT EARS FOR SHE'S ONLY FIVE AND TWENTY
533-131564-0012 BUT HANG IT IT'S NOT MY FAULT
533-131564-0009  OH NO I COULDN'T STAND THAT
533-131564-0011 NOW DON'T FORCE INTO A TEMPEST AT THAT
533-131564-0015  I KNOW THEY ARE BLESS THEM
533-131564-0016  HE FOLLOWED ME INTO THE LIBRARY
533-131564-0010 FIRE AND FURY
533-131564-0022  WHERE IS MILICENT
5442-32873-0006 BRIGHT AND NATTY WITH THE CHINTZ CURTAINS AND THE LITTLE TOILET SET OUT NOT INELEGANTLY AND HER PET PIPING GOLDFINCH ASLEEP ON HIS PERCH WITH A BIT OF SUGAR BETWEEN THE WIRES OF A CAGE HER PILLOWS SO WHITE AND UNPRESSED WITH ITS LITTLE EDGING OF LACE
5442-32873-0009  THERE DON'T MIND ME SHE SAID SHARPLY AND GETTING UP SHE LOOKED DOWN AT HER DRESS AND THIN SHOES AND SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HERSELF SHE TOOK THE CANDLE HE HAD JUST SET DOWN AND WENT SWIFTLY TO HER ROOM
6432-63722-0038 AND DONALAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT
6432-63722-0030  YOU'RE NOT AS SCREAMISH AS ALL THAT ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE IT WAS IN A DEAD MAN'S HANDS AND A WOMAN'S
6432-63722-0033  AND I'VE READ ENOUGH ABOUT GERMS TO KNOW THE DANGER I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL
6432-63722-0040  DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF ON IT WHATEVER YOU DO WHY NOT
6432-63722-0034  IF YOU DON'T MIND I SHOULD LIKE TO EXAMINE THIS A BIT
6432-63722-0028 AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES IT'S HERE
6432-63722-0026 SURE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
6432-63722-0039  ASKED THE SURPRISED DETECTIVE YES
6432-63722-0031 AND DONALD'S VOICE WAS PLAINLY SKEPTICAL
6432-63722-0032  YES IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES ON IT
6432-63722-0043  ALL RIGHT BE THERE IN A SECOND
6432-63722-0041 SIMPLY BECAUSE THIS WATCH DOESN'T WORK
6432-63722-0055 WHAT IS IT? PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
6432-63722-0056 THE OLD ADAGE OF TWO HEADS IS BETTER, YOU KNOW
6432-63722-0049  AND YOU I DON'T WANT IT EITHER
6432-63722-0042 SOMEONE OUT HERE TO SEE YOU
6432-63723-0001  AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREOLE COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
6432-63723-0007  IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARGE STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE, DO YOU? ASKED THE COLONEL. THAT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0000  CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
5484-24317-0007  THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS A DOUBT WHICH HAD ARISED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0004  THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005  HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MERCILESS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5442-41169-0030  THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5484-24317-0008  THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0002  SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY HERMANN'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENNO
5484-24317-0010  WHEN HERMAN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5442-41169-0029  THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TODAY
6432-63723-0006  IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
6432-63722-0058  NO ALIMONY REPLIED THE COLONEL PUZZLED YES JUST THAT
6432-63723-0010  AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011  HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012  SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0002  THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNETH
6432-63723-0009  THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
6432-63723-0005  WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
6432-63722-0059  AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
5442-41169-0001  HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND HIM
5442-41169-0004  THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0003  I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON, YOUR EXCELLENCY? FINE CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 LUSTIER ARE OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S MEN
5442-41168-0024  AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025  THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION
5442-41169-0010 THEN TOO, ONE MUST KEEP UP CONNECTIONS
5442-41169-0008 WHY, WHAT IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND?
5442-41169-0009  THERE IS NO MEANING IN IT AT ALL
5764-299665-0055  LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES AND HAS FAILED
5764-299665-0063 ARE CHRISTIANS MORE TEMPERATE, MORE VIRTUOUS, MORE HONEST THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0060  RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
5764-299665-0062  IT HAS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0053  THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN ADULTERATED CURSE
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR HONOR AS ARMS
5764-299665-0058 HAS THE BIBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0064  CAN WE CURE DISEASE BY SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0052  THEY MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF GLADNESS
6432-63723-0046  THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTRE FIGURE BEING THAT OF HARRY KING AND HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED
6432-63723-0047  THAT IS NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES IT HAPPENED TO BE SO NOW
6432-63723-0049 I SAID WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED: "TOGETHER WE'VE MISSED YOU"
6938-70848-0001 THE COLDS AND RHEUMATISM OF THE RAINY MONTHS VANISHED
6432-63723-0045  THE STOPPED CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANY THEORY
6938-70848-0002 AS TO WHETHER LAST SUNDAY YOU DID IT WHEN THE YUNKERS
6938-70848-0000  EVEN THE SUN CAME OUT PALE AND WATERY AT NOON
6432-63723-0057  NOW HARRY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
6432-63723-0051  WHY POLONIUS SOME ONE ASKS
6432-63723-0056  THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELER
6070-86744-0016  DID YOU EVER MEET HIM PREVIOUSLY TO COMING HITHER
6070-86744-0017  UPON MY HONOUR THEN LISTEN TO ME
6070-86745-0002  AT A QUARTER TO TEN THE VALLEY ENTERED HE COMPOSED WITH A LITTLE ROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND CUT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0012  I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE A RIDE FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013  PESTS I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE
6070-86745-0008  YOU WHOM I EXPECTED LAST YOU ARRIVE AT FIVE MINUTES TO TEN WHEN THE TIME FIXED WAS HALF PAST
6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THE DAY TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISHES IT
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING LUCY AND GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY REALLY ALARMS ME
6070-86745-0010 YES HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BORDEAUX IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6938-70848-0011 THIS LAST WAS THE YOUNG GENERATION WHO HAD BEEN SERVING IN THE ARMY
6938-70848-0014 FEARFUL TUMULT CRIES DOWN WITH THE BOLSHEVIKI
6938-70848-0004 HAVEN'T I GOT SOMETHING TO REMEMBER THEM BY THE DEVILS
6938-70848-0008  TO PEACE AND OTHER PEOPLE OF RUSSIA WAIT UNTIL THE PEASANTS
6938-70848-0012  WHEREUPON THE OLD EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE LEFT THE HALL
6938-70848-0013  DOWN WITH HIM THEY SHRIEKED
7018-75788-0003 UPON THIS HE BROUGHT ME A COTTON BAG AND GAVE IT TO ME SAID TAKE THIS BAG AND FILL IT WITH PEBBLES FROM THE BEACH AND GO FORTH WITH A COMPANY OF THE TOWNSFOLK TO WHOM I WILL GIVE A CHARGE RESPECTING THEE
6938-70848-0019 ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES
7018-75788-0000  THEN I TOOK UP A GREAT STONE FROM AMONG THE TREES AND COMING UP TO HIM SMOTE HIM THEREWITH ON THE HEAD WITH ALL MY MIGHT AND CRUSHED IN HIS SKULL AS HE LAY DEAD DRUNK
6938-70848-0022 THE FIRST STAGE WAS THE CRUSHING OF AUTOCRACY AND THE CRUSHING OF THE POWER OF THE INDUSTRIAL CAPITALIST AND THE LANDOWNERS WHOSE INTEREST ARE CLOSELY RELATED
6938-70848-0018 BUT THIS WORTH BOTH WAGES THE LAST SOCIAL AND REVOLUTIONIST DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
6938-70848-0015 UPON MY RETURN I VISITED MOLLY NO SUCH ACCUSATION WAS MADE AGAINST ME THERE AFTER A BRIEF CONVERSATION I LEFT AND THAT SAID LET ANYONE PRESENT MAKE SUCH AN ACCUSATION
6938-70848-0017  BY DECLARING THEIR ASSEMBLY EXTRAORDINARY CONFERENCE IT HAD BEEN PLANNED TO PLOT THE REELECTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
6938-70848-0016 MEANWHILE THE QUESTION OF THE STATUS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS AGITATING ALL MINDS
6938-70848-0006 WHO ARE YOU A COUNTER REVOLUTIONIST A PROVOCATOR THEY BELOVED AT HIM
6938-70848-0007 YOU CALL YOURSELVES THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA BUT YOU ARE NOT THE PEOPLE OF RUSSIA
6938-70848-0010  THIS MAN HAS PATIENTLY WELCOMED THE CALL TO A CONGRESS OF PEASANTS
6938-70848-0009  WE KNOW WHAT THE PEASANTS WILL SAY AREN'T THEY WORKING MEN LIKE OURSELVES
6938-70848-0005 WHO ARE YOU TO DESTROY THE LEGAL GOVERNMENT WHO IS LEADING A GERMAN
6938-70848-0003  WELL DIDN'T HE SHOOT US ONE MAN EXHIBITED HIS ARM IN ITS SLING
5764-299665-0036  THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MEMBERS
5764-299665-0037  THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE
5764-299665-0049  COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0048  COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WORSE WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0038  AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0046  WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0043  IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY OR AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0041  THE SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0050  WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR THEM
5764-299665-0044  MAN HAS DECEIVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0040  A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER
5764-299665-0039  THE IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED
5764-299665-0042  MAN JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045  HAS CHRISTIANITY DONE GOOD
5764-299665-0051  THEY HATED PLEASURE
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT THIS MASTER PUNISHES AND REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITANS BELIEVE THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0056  THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT
5442-41169-0011  IT'S A MORTAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT
5442-41169-0002  IS SUCH A BLACKGUARD
5442-41169-0015 IF WE ARE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD A CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEP ON MISTLETOE EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDENS NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0019  AND ONCE MORE THE LAND OWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0014  THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0023 HERE YOU HAVE THOUSANDS OF LIMBS AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BARK
5442-41169-0020  SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES IT
5442-41169-0013 THEY'RE PROPRIETORS OF A SORT BUT WE ARE THE LANDOWNERS
5442-41169-0018  OH WELL ONE DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLOR HERSELF THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63241-0002  RANSON WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
6128-63241-0012  HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPIAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0009  OLIVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE LADIES ON BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THE BUTTE
6128-63244-0002  PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRENTS MISSUS FARRINDER ADDED IN A TURN AS EXPLANATORY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH THE SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIERARCHY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARRINDER SUPPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN HER REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EMANCIPATION OF THEIR SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BONDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0009  CHARLEY WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WIDE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT THE CARED MUCH THE MOST
5764-299665-0061  RELIGION HAS NEVER MADE MEN FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE GONE TO THE STONES
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNERSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM AND TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073  IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HATH BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0080  WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0074  IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE AND A DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0071  THE FIRST STONE IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHANGE RISE AND THERE CAN BE NO BROKEN NO MISSING LINK
5764-299665-0083  FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
5764-299665-0070  I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORNER STONES
6432-63722-0009  PERHAPS NOT ADMITTED COLONEL ASHLEY
6432-63722-0016  THE VERY PAIR I WAS GOING TO BUY
6432-63722-0012  I'M WORKING IN THE INTEREST OF THE YOUNG MAN
6432-63722-0015  GAD EXPLAINED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0037  AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALLIE'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS HEAVY CANDLESTICK NEAR IT
6432-63722-0027  MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOS TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THOUGHT WITH A NODDED DESIROUS COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY IT'LL HAVE THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0029 THAT'S THE WATCH ANNOUNCED THE HEADQUARTERS DETECTIVE REACHING IN FOR IT GOING TO SEE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE CAME TOWARD THE WORLD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0035  THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MORAL
5764-299665-0028  HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0024  IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE ANOTHER
5764-299665-0034  THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
5764-299665-0033 WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS
5764-299665-0021 WAS THERE GOODNESS WAS THERE WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0023 MOST PEOPLE CLING TO THE SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0025  WHAT IS THIS POWER
5764-299665-0031  IT IS A RESULT
6432-63722-0045  I WANT TO TALK OVER DARCY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD TALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
6432-63722-0048  AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVING BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0047  RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION
6432-63722-0046  WHAT ARE THE JUDGES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0051  BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING OUT FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK
6432-63722-0052  IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I'LL PRETEND I'M FISHING AND I MAY CATCH SOMETHING
6432-63722-0054 I'D RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU INSTEAD OF BLACKSTONE THANKS LAUGHED KENNETH
6432-63722-0050  BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW
6432-63722-0053 IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING THAT I WILL END MY FISHING
6432-63722-0044 FISHING THE FOOT WAS THE PANTING ANSWER
5484-24318-0005  DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24317-0033  IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN END AS A BOON FROM THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0006  WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
5484-24318-0002  WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
5484-24318-0000  NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BUT THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PALACE THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0012  SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
6432-63723-0033  DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
6432-63723-0037 IT WAS I LARCH
6432-63723-0038  THEY TOOK HARRY AWAY A WHILE AGO

6432-63723-0054  YET IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
6432-63723-0055 I WENT OVER THEM NEAR THE DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
6432-63723-0053  THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BARS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
6432-63723-0048  I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONES HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO USE YET OF WHAT HE MADE SO LITTLE USE OF LATE

5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COARSE SURGY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND ROUSED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-32873-0013  HE SLACKENED A SPACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THE MODEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LUKE WAGGETT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK ON HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKE AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DARK CART WAS TRUNDLED OUT INTO THE LINE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP AND THE STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE THE FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLEST GAVE PRAISES OF THE TOWN RESULTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUB LIFE AND OFTEN PREVAILED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING

8131-117016-0004 EVEN DERELICTS AND FAILURES HAD TO EAT. THERE WERE STORIES AND SHOPS THROUGHOUT THE DISTRICT WHICH EKED OUT SOME KIND OF A MARGINAL LIVING
7975-280085-0010 SIX STEPPED TO THE FRONT: SHERIFF GLISPIN, COLONEL T L VAULT, B M RICE, G A BRADFORD, C A POMROY, AND S J SAVERSON
8131-117016-0002 SOME OF MARS' LAWS DATED FROM THE TIME WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT HAD BEEN HAMPERED BY LACK OF MEN RATHER THAN BY THE TYPE OF MEN
7975-280085-0011  FORMING IN LINE FOUR PACES APART HE ORDERED THEM TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY AND CONCENTRATE THE FIRE OF THE WHOLE LINE THE INSTANT THE ROBBERS WERE DISCOVERED

7105-2330-0041 THE LOCAL TRADE UNIONISTS TOOK OFFENCE AT THE FACT OF CABINET MINISTERS HAVING PERSONALLY ACTED AS STRIKE BREAKERS AND EVEN THE RELEASE OF PLATTER BATH FAILED TO PACIFY THEM
7105-2340-0001  WELL THE FAILING STILL EXISTS DOESN'T IT SAID THE HUSBAND OR DO YOU SUPPOSE A REFORM OF CHARACTER IS ENTAILED ALONG WITH THE ESTATE
7105-2340-0003 WHEN A MAN IS ABSOLUTELY WEALTHY NOT MERELY WELL TO DO ALL SUSPICION OF SORDID MOTIVE NATURAL DISAPPEARS THE THING BECOMES MERELY A PARISIAN MALADY
7105-2330-0039 THE WORD OF THE SOUND HAD REFERENCE IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THE INCARCERATING GOVERNMENT AND NOT TO THE DESTROYER OF THE ALBERT HALL
7105-2330-0035  THE ORDERS HAVE A PRIVATE BAND OF THEIR OWN SAID THE GOVERNOR BUT OF COURSE I COULDN'T ALLOW THE MEN THEMSELVES

7975-280076-0026  I STAYED THERE UNTIL THE EIGHTH OF FEBRUARY EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
7975-280084-0006  ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THE BANK

7902-96591-0014  THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP WHILST THE BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE

7105-2340-0034  MISSUS PETER TURNED TO HER GUEST WITH CONFIDENTIAL KINDNESS
7105-2340-0027  THIS SNATCHER HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THIS MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0022 IT'S THE ONLY THING TO DO
7975-280076-0000  ALTHOUGH EVERY BOOK PURPORTING TO NARRATE THE LIVES OF THE YOUNGER BROTHERS HAS TOLD OF THE LIBERTY ROBBERY AND IMPLIED THAT WE HAD A PART IN IT THE YOUNGERS WERE NOT SUSPECTED AT THAT TIME NOR FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARD
7975-280076-0003  NO WARRANT WAS ISSUED FOR THE YOUNGERS BUT SUBSEQUENT HISTORIANS HAVE INFERENTIALLY AT LEAST ACCUSED US OF TAKING PART BUT AS I SAID BEFORE THERE IS NO TRUTH IN THE ACCUSATION
7975-280063-0006 THE JACKMEN WITH A PARTY OF THIRTY SEASONED MEN CHARGED THE INDIANA GUNS AND CAPTURED THEM BUT MAJOR FOSTER LED A GALLANT CHARGE AGAINST THE INVADERS AND RECAPTURED THE PIECES
7975-280076-0001 IT WAS CLAIMED BY PEOPLE OF LIBERTY THAT THEY POSITIVELY RECOGNIZED AMONG THE ROBBERS AL SHEPARD RED MARKERS AND BUD PENCE WHO HAD SEEN SERVICE WITH QUANTRILLE

7975-280063-0005 I THINK HE'LL BE RATHER TO HAVE MET FOR BREAKFAST I REPLIED HE MIGHT BE ALL RIGHT FOR DINNER
7975-280063-0009 MAJOR FOSTER IN A LETTER TO GEORGE FROM GEORGIA INVENTOR OF MINNEAPOLIS SAID

7902-96592-0020  NONSENSE
7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR A SCREECHING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0028  A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOR IN VAIN
7902-96595-0022 SURELY HE CRIED SIR IS DAN EXCITEDLY
7902-96595-0020  I HAVE SEEN NO ONE ANSWERING TO THE DESCRIPTION HERE
7902-96595-0024  LIDDY GRAHAM LOOKED GHASTLY
7902-96595-0023  SIR RICHARD WAS SILENT
7975-280057-0019 ONE OF MY OLD SCHOOL TEACHERS WHOM I HAVE NEVER SEEN SINCE THE SPRINGER SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO IS STEPHEN B ELKINS SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA
7975-280057-0015 TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SAME PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
7975-280063-0000 WE TOOK THE OATH PERHAPS THREE HUNDRED OF US DOWN ON LUTHER MASON'S FARM A FEW MILES FROM WHERE I NOW WRITE WHERE COLONEL HAYS HAD ENCAMPED AFTER INDEPENDENCE
7975-280057-0016  I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS A DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
7975-280057-0009  MISS WELL STAYED TO GUARD THE REMAINS WHILE HER SON CARRIED THE NEWS OF THE MURDER TO COLONEL PEABODY OF THE FEDERAL COMMAND WHO WAS THEN IN CAMP AT KANSAS CITY
7975-280063-0002 ACCORDINGLY I WAS SHORTLY AWAKENED TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO LOANJACK WHERE HE WOULD PERSONALLY MAKE KNOWN THE SITUATION TO THE OTHER COLONELS
7018-75789-0012  SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0010  WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SECOND NIGHT
7018-75789-0000  WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT

7018-75789-0031  WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA

7018-75789-0030 A SECOND FISH RAISED ITS APPEARANCE AND WHICH WE HAD SEEN NOUGHT MORE MONSTROUS
7018-75789-0023  WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THIRD NIGHT
7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD THE SEAMAN
7902-96591-0019 NO, THAT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THAT
7902-96592-0001  I'M GOING HOME TO BREAKFAST
7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS, HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED, AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN, JUST AS HE DREW NEAR, THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW. A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS, THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOT TOES AGAINST STONEWORK, AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNG MAGICIAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY? FALSE ALARM TILL SIR RISDON, THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL AWAY TONIGHT. SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER WROTE
7902-96592-0011  NO HE WAS NOT DREAMING FOR HE WAS LOOKING OUT ON THE SEA OVER WHICH A FAINT MIST HUNG LIKE WREATHS OF SMOKE
7902-96592-0007 BUT HOW QUEER FOR MR. GERROW TO BE TALKING LIKE THAT. DANGEROUS TEAL, THE BOY WHO HELPED THE COOK
7902-96592-0019 IT WAS YOU FATHER KICKED FOR SHIRKING, AND MY, WELL I HARDLY KNEW YOU
7902-96592-0009  THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM, HE COULD RUN, AND BY DAYLIGHT, THE SMUGGLERS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN
7902-96592-0017 GO ROUND AND OPEN THE DOOR. I WAS SHUT IN LAST NIGHT BY MISTAKE
7975-280085-0006  THE WHISTLE ON THE OLD MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED
7975-280084-0010  EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TROT TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
7975-280085-0007 HE HAD TO SLEEP WITH A PILLOW ON MY BREAST JIM BEING ALSO CRIPPLED WITH A WOUND IN HIS SHOULDER AND WE COULD NOT GET MUCH SLEEP
7975-280085-0004  FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT TO
7975-280084-0016 THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUCKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL FITZ CHASED HIM WITH A BULLET
7975-280084-0014  AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
7975-280084-0011  DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UPSTAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
7975-280085-0001 FRIDAY WE MOVED TOWARD WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMPED BETWEEN ELYSIAN AND GERMAN LAKE
7975-280084-0012 CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLER'S MARE
7975-280085-0000  THAT NIGHT IT STARTED TO RAIN AND WE WORE OUT OUR HORSES
7975-280063-0003 FOSTER HAD NEARLY ONE THOUSAND CAVERNMEN AND TWO PIECES OF RAPID INDIAN A BATTERY THAT HAD ALREADY MADE FOR ITSELF A NAME FOR HARD FIGHTING
7975-280057-0018  ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT LEFFINGTON WEEKLY
7975-280057-0014 BUT SHE FAILED TO FIND THE COMFORT SHE SOUGHT FOR ANNOYANCES CONTINUED IN A MORE AGGRAVATED FORM
7975-280057-0012 NOW LADY CALL ON YOUR PROTECTORS WHAT DON'T YOU CALL ON CALL YOUNGER NOW
7975-280063-0001 BOTH YOU AND MYSELF MAKE COFFEE IN THE REST BELOW ROSE HILL ON GRAND RIVER
7975-280057-0017  FROM HARRISON BILL SHE WENT TO WAVERLEY WHERE SHE WAS HOUNDED CONTINUALLY
7975-280057-0020  WHEN I WAS TAKEN PRISONER I EXPECTED TO BE SHOT WITHOUT CEREMONY
7975-280057-0010 MISS MACK, A CORPORAL, JUMPED FROM THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE AND ESCAPED
7975-280057-0011  AS THE RAIDERS LEFT ONE OF THEM SHOUTED

7902-96594-0029  PIPE AWAY THEM INTO THAT BOAT THERE HE SAID AND AS THE CREW SPRANG IN
7902-96594-0023 BAY PARDON DIDN'T MEAN NOW SIR SAID THE SAILOR TOUCHING HIS FORELOCK
7902-96594-0028  AT LAST THE LITTLE LIEUTENANT COULD BEAR THE ANXIETY NO LONGER

7902-96594-0022 NOW THEN WHY DO YOU WANT TO GO ASHORE
7902-96595-0002 WHAT TRAGEDY OF YONDER
7975-280063-0007  WE WERE OUT OF AMMUNITION AND WERE HELPLESS HAD THE FIGHT BEEN PRESSED
7975-280063-0012  THE WOUNDS OF BOTH FORCES WERE GATHERED UP AND WERE PLACED IN HOUSES
7975-280076-0006  THE PARTS OF THIS LETTER NOW RELEVANT ARE AS FOLLOWS
7975-280063-0008  THEY DID MARK MY CLOTHES IN ONE OR TWO PLACES HOWEVER

7975-280063-0004  COME IN COLONEL HAYES EXCLAIMED COLONEL COCKER
7975-280076-0014 DURING THE SUMMER I WAS EITHER IN SAINT CLAIR JACKSON OR KANSAS BUT AS THERE WAS NO ROBBERY COMMITTED THAT SUMMER IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHERE I WAS
7975-280076-0009 AT THE TIME OF THE GALLATIN BANK ROBBERY I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE I HAD BOUGHT FROM PLACE TAYLOR AND RECTOR
7975-280076-0008  I WILL GIVE YOU THIS OUTLINE AND SKETCH OF MY WHEREABOUTS AND ACTIONS AT THE TIME OF CERTAIN ROBBERIES WITH WHICH I AM CHARGED
7975-280076-0010 THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO SHERIFF BARKLEY AND FIFTY OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
7105-2330-0003  OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMAGE AT PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0002  VICTORY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH COULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0001  HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER
7105-2330-0004 I HAD LONG PARDON AND THE EVE OF A BY ELECTION WITH THREATS OF A HEAVY VOTING DEFECTION IF IT WERE WITHHELD OR EVEN DELAYED WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE A SURRENDER BUT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE ONE
7105-2330-0014 NOT LATER THAN SEVEN THIRTY PM SAID A CHIEF ORGANIZER I HAVE PROMISED THE AGENT DOWN THERE THAT HE SHALL BE ABLE TO DISPLAY POSTERS ANNOUNCING PLATTER BATH IS OUT BEFORE THE POLL OPENS
7105-2330-0005  HENCE THE ANXIETY IN THE CROWDED COURT AND IN THE LITTLE GROUPS GATHERED ROUND THE TAPE MACHINES IN WHITEHALL AND DONNING STREET AND OTHER AFFECTED CENTRES
7105-2330-0009 THE JURY WISHED TO ADD A WRITER DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT A BY ELECTION IS PENDING IN THE PARLIAMENTARY DIVISION OF NEMESIS ON HAND
7105-2330-0006  THE JURY RETURNED FROM CONSIDERING THEIR VERDICT THERE WAS A FLUTTER AN EXCITED MURMUR A DEATHLIKE HUSH
7105-2330-0010 AND MAY THE LORD HAVE MERCY ON THE POLE A JUNIOR COUNSEL EXCLAIMED IRREVERENTLY
7105-2330-0013 SEVEN THIRTY AMENDED THE PRIME MINISTER WE MUST AVOID ANY APPEARANCE OF PRECIPITANCY
7902-96591-0006 PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT, ARCHIE WAS SILENT

7902-96592-0003  STOP HERE TILL SIR RISDON COMES DOWN AND TELL HIM I'M VERY SORRY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW JERRY AND ANDY'S LOBSTER BOAT COMING INTO THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOUSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHIE RAY STROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT, HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD-FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE, FIREPLACE, AND CHIMNEY
7018-75788-0008  WE WEIGHED ANCHOR AND SHAHRAZAD PERCEIVED THE DAWN OF DAY AND CEASED TO SAY IN HER PERMITTED SAY
7018-75788-0012  AFTER WHICH I RETURNED TO MY OLD MERRY WAY OF LIFE AND FORGOT ALL I HAD SUFFERED IN THE GREAT PROFIT AND GAIN I HAD MADE
7018-75788-0016 PRESENTLY THE SHIP STRUCK THE MOUNTAIN AND BROKE UP AND THEN EVERYTHING ON BOARD OF HER WAS PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75788-0004  DO AS THEY DO AND BELIKE THOU SHALT GAIN WHAT MAY FURTHER THY RETURN VOYAGE TO THY NATIVE LAND

7018-75788-0010 AND CEASED NOT SAILING TILL WE ARRIVED SAFELY AT BASRAH
7018-75788-0009  WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINTH NIGHT
7018-75789-0001 THEN SIGNED FOR MYSELF I SET TO WORK COLLECTING A NUMBER OF PIECES OF CHINESE AND CAMFOR AND ALOES WOOD AND I BOUND THEM TOGETHER WITH ROPES FROM THE WRECKAGE THEN I CHOSE OUT FROM THE BROKEN UP SHIPS STRAIGHT PLANKS OF EVEN SIZE AND FIXED THEM FIRMLY UPON THE ALOES WOOD AND I TIED IT TIGHTLY AND FIRMLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NAILED
7018-75789-0011 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT SINDBAD THE SEAMAN CONTINUED WHEN I LANDED AND FOUND MYSELF AMONGST THE INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS AND HAD TAKEN SOME REST THEY CONSULTED AMONG THEMSELVES AND SAID TO ONE ANOTHER THERE IS NO HELP FOR IT BUT WE CARRY HIM WITH US AND PRESENT HIM TO OUR KING
7018-75789-0004  AND I THREW MYSELF DOWN UPON MY FACE ON THE RAFT BY REASON OF THE NARROWNESS OF THE CHANNEL WHILST THE STREAM CEASED NOT TO CARRY ME ALONG KNOWING NOT NIGHT FROM DAY FOR THE EXCESS OF THE GLOOM WHICH ENCOMPASSED ME ABOUT IN MY TERROR AND CONCERN FOR MYSELF LEST I SHOULD PERISH
7018-75789-0008  O MY BROTHER ANSWERED HE WE A HUSBANDMAN AND TILLERS OF THE SOIL WHO CAME OUT TO WATER OUR FIELDS AND PLANTATIONS AND FINDING THERE ASLEEP ON THIS RAFT LAID HOLD OF IT AND MADE IT FAST BY US AGAINST THOU SHOULDEST AWAKE AT THY LEISURE
7018-75789-0002 LAND AFTER LAND SHALT THOU SEEK AND FIND BUT NO OTHER LIFE ON THY WISH SHALL WAIT FRET NOT THY SOUL IN THY THOUGHTS OR NIGHT ALL WOES SHALL END OR SOONER OR LATE
7018-75789-0005  WHEN I AWOKE AT LAST I FOUND MYSELF IN THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN AND OPENING MY EYES I SAW MYSELF IN A BROAD STREAM AND THE RAFT MOORED TO AN ISLAND IN THE MIDST OF A NUMBER OF INDIANS AND ABYSSINIANS
7018-75789-0014  QUOTH HE THOU ART THINE OWN MASTER YET IF IT BE THY WILL TO ABIDE WITH US HONOUR HEAD AND EYES BE IT FOR THOU GLADDENEST US WITH THY COMPANY
7018-75789-0013  SO I ROSE WITHOUT STAY OR DELAY AND KISSED THE KING'S HAND AND ACQUAINTED HIM WITH MY LONGING TO SET OUT WITH THE MERCHANTS FOR THAT I PINED AFTER MY PEOPLE AND MY OWN LAND
7018-75789-0015  BY ALLAH ARE MY LORD ANSWERED I THOU HAST INDEED OVERWHELMED ME WITH THY FAVOURS AND WELL DOINGS BUT I WEARY FOR A SIGHT OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY AND NATIVE COUNTRY
7018-75789-0009  I ANSWERED FOR ALLAH'S SAKE AND MY LORD ERE I SPEAK GIVE ME SOMEWHAT TO EAT FOR I AM STARVING AND AFTER ASK ME WHAT THOU WILT
7018-75789-0007 WHEN THEY SAW I UNDERSTOOD THEM ARIGHT AND MADE THEM NO ANSWER ONE OF THEM CAME FORWARD AND SAID TO ME IN ARABIC PEACE BE WITH THEE O MY BROTHER
7018-75789-0003  I RODE MY CONVEYANCE INTO THE PLACE WHICH WAS INTENSELY DARK AND THE CURRENT CARRIED ME THE RAFT WITH IT DOWN THE UNDERGROUND CHANNEL
7105-2340-0017  OF COURSE SOME OF THEM CAN BE CHANGED
7105-2340-0016  WE FEEL THAT WE MUST LIVE UNCLEAN FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0006  AND THE REPUTATION WAS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
7105-2340-0009 SIGNED WILFRID PEACH AND COAT

7105-2340-0031  SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS

7105-2340-0018 I PUT IT DOWN BY THE CLAREAGE OF SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT
7105-2340-0012  IN THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THEIR NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED

8280-266249-0063  YE ARE ALL THE CHILDREN OF GOD BY FAITH IN CHRIST JESUS
8461-258277-0006  NOW THE CAUSE OF HER SLAYING HER SIRE WAS AS FOLLOWS
8461-258277-0005  AND SHE THREW DOWN THE JEW'S HEAD BEFORE HIM
8461-258277-0000 WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND A NIGHT
8280-266249-0064  YE ARE ALL ONE IN CHRIST JESUS
8461-258277-0011  KNOWEST THOU WHITHER HE WENT
8131-117016-0029  TO FIND A PHONE AND CALL THE WAGON
8131-117016-0024  GORDON'S EYES POPPED AT THAT
8131-117016-0052  AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN
8131-117016-0037  IF HE SHOULD TURN UP DEAD I'LL KNOW YOU BOYS ARE RESPONSIBLE AND I'LL FIND YOU
8131-117016-0043 NO THE COPS THAT ARE GIVING ME WERE COVERED GORDON

8188-269288-0054 TIRED OUT, LESLIE HERSELF DROPPED ASLEEP
8188-269288-0052  ANNIE'S MANNER WAS VERY MYSTERIOUS
8188-269288-0050 CERTAINLY STUDIOUSLY
8188-269290-0002 I'M NOT COMING SAID ANNIE
8188-269288-0047  I AM SLEEPY I SHALL SLEEP
8188-269290-0000  THE GIRL OF SAINT ELIZABETH
8188-269290-0008  I KNOW YOU DON'T QUITE MEAN WHAT YOU SAY SAID LESLIE BUT OF COURSE IF YOU REALLY WISH ME
8188-269290-0011  LESLIE WAS JUST CLOSING THE DOOR BEHIND HER WHEN ANNIE CALLED AFTER HER
8188-269290-0010  WRAPPING A PRETTY BLUE SHAWL AROUND HER HIDDEN SHOULDERS SHE TURNED TO ANNIE
8188-269290-0017 AS SHE WALKED DOWN THE CORRIDOR SHE HEARD IT BEING TURNED IN THE LOCK
8188-269288-0011  A FEW MOMENTS LATER THERE CAME A TAP AT THE DOOR
8188-269288-0000 ANY COLCHESTER HAD BEGUN TO MAKE PLANS WITH LIZZIE
8188-269288-0006  I WOULD BE THE CONSTANT WORRY AND PLAGUE OF YOUR LIFE
8188-269288-0003  SHE HAD NO IDEA OF ALLOWING HERSELF TO BREAK DOWN
8188-269288-0005  WHY YOU WILL BE PARTING FROM ME YOU KNOW
8188-269288-0004  WHAT DO YOU MEAN REPLIED LESLIE
8188-269288-0013  JANE HERRIET STOOD WITHOUT
8188-269288-0012  LESLIE OPENED THE DOOR
8188-269288-0030 LESLIE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND FLUNG IT OPEN SHE PUT HER HEAD OUT AND TRIED TO PEER INTO THE DARKNESS BUT THE MOON HAD ALREADY SET AND SHE COULD NOT SEE MORE THAN A COUPLE OF YARDS IN FRONT OF HER
8188-269288-0016  HER EYES SHONE WITH PLEASURE AT THE ANTICIPATION OF THE DELIGHTFUL TIME SHE WOULD HAVE REVELLING IN THE HOME NEWS THE OTHER LETTER WAS DIRECTED TO ANY COLCHESTER
8131-117016-0049  NOBODY WANTS HIM EXCEPT A GANG OF CROOKS AND THOSE IN POWER
8131-117016-0047  MARDOC BLINKED HE DROPPED HIS EYES SLOWLY
8131-117016-0042  BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED FINALLY SIGHING
8131-117016-0038  TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THOUGH
8131-117016-0048  WHAT MAKES YOU THINK WAIN WILL BE RE ELECTED
8131-117016-0044  BUT THE STERN WALL GANG IS BACKING WAIN
8131-117016-0045  BUT IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH ON THEM
8131-117016-0050  EVER SEE A MARTIAN ELECTION
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOROBS OF THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORISED PRECINCT HOUSE
8131-117017-0002  AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HAYE'S SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8188-269288-0022 LESLIE SEATED HERSELF WITH HER BACK TO HER COMPANION AND OPENED HER OWN LETTERS
8188-269288-0020  WELL READ IT IN PEACE SAID LESLIE I WON'T DISTURB YOU
8188-269288-0029  NOW I REMEMBER SHE GOT A LETTER WHICH UPSET HER VERY MUCH AND WENT OUT
8188-269288-0018  HER FACE GREW SUDDENLY WHITE AS DEATH WHAT IS IT DEAR
8188-269288-0027  JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT SHE ROSE WITH A SIGH TO PREPARE FOR BED
8188-269288-0019 I HAVE BEEN STARVING OR RATHER I HAVE BEEN THIRSTING
8188-269288-0015  LESLIE THANKED HER AND EAGERLY GRASPED THE LITTLE PARCEL
8188-269288-0024  I MUST GO INTO THE GROUNDS THE AIR IS STIFLING
8188-269288-0017 HERE IS A LETTER FOR YOU ANNIE CRIED LIZZIE

8188-269290-0025  I BELIEVE POOR ANNIE IS DREADFULLY UNHAPPY
8188-269290-0024  THAT IS IF YOU CARE TO CONFIDE IN ME
8188-269290-0022  SOME DAY JANE YOU MUST SEE HER
8188-269290-0027  REFUSES TO COME SHE CRIED
8188-269290-0030  I'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE SAID LIZZIE
8188-269290-0028  SHE'LL GET IN HER AWFUL SCRAPE
8188-269290-0031 DO COME ANNIE DO
8188-269290-0048  AFTER THE ADDRESS THE GIRLS THEMSELVES WERE ENCOURAGED TO SPEAK AND A VERY ANIMATED DISCUSSION FOLLOWED
8188-269290-0047 FOR ALL WHO SIN ALL WHO SUFFER YOU ARE TO A CERTAIN EXTENT RESPONSIBLE
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THE DIRE PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WITH THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054  HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117017-0001  IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANY HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117016-0058  THE GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT
8131-117017-0003 GORDON HIT THE SIGNAL SWITCH AND THE MARS SPEAKER LET OUT A SHRILL WHISTLE
8131-117016-0057 BUT YOU GOT EARTH IDEAS OF THE STUFF LIKE I HAD ONCE
8131-117016-0056 BECAUSE HE IS ALWAYS HONEST ACCORDING TO HOW HE SEES IT
8131-117016-0061 BUT THERE PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE TIME FOR IT IF MAYOR WAIN WAS RE-ELECTED
8131-117016-0059  IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS HERE
8131-117016-0055 COST A MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE
8131-117029-0009  THOUGHT YOU'D BE IN THE CHIPS
8131-117029-0016  YOU CAN'T STAY HERE
8188-269288-0002 HER TASTES ALL LAY IN THIS DIRECTION, HER IDEA BEING BY AND BY TO FOLLOW HER MOTHER'S PROFESSION OF JOURNALISM, FOR WHICH SHE ALREADY SHOWED CONSIDERABLE APTITUDE
8188-269288-0007 IT IS THIS: IF BY ANY CHANCE YOU DON'T LEAVE SAINT WORDS, ANNIE, I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO BE YOUR ROOM FELLOW AGAIN NEXT TERM
8188-269288-0014 THESE LETTERS HAVE JUST COME FOR YOU AND ANNIE COLCHESTER, SHE SAID, AND AS I WAS COMING UPSTAIRS I THOUGHT I WOULD LEAVE THEM WITH YOU
8131-117029-0022  HE GRABBED GORDON'S HAND AND WADDLED DOWN THE LANDING PLANK AS HE SHOOK HIS HEAD
8188-269288-0009  BUT SHE ADDED ABRUPTLY YOU SPEAK OF SOMETHING WHICH MUST NOT TAKE PLACE
8188-269288-0008  SAID ANNIE A FLASH OF LIGHT COMING INTO HER EYES AND THEN LEAVING THEM
8188-269288-0001 LESLIE DETERMINED TO TRIPLE HONORS IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE
8188-269288-0010  I MUST PASS AN HONOURS IF I DON'T I SHALL DIE
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002  THE CASE OF LORD MONTORUS OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS A MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHIEF OFFICIALS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE CAPITAL AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY: BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0008  MY LORDS I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-269290-0053 I AM AFRAID, I AM, REPLIED LIZZIE, DISTRESSED NOW IN HER TONE
8188-269290-0056 THE GIRL WHO BREAKS THE RULES HAS TO BE PUNISHED
8188-274364-0004 WHERE IS THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-269290-0055  EXCUSES MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
8188-269290-0057  I WILL TELL HER
8131-117017-0030 AND IF ANY OF THE OTHER COPS HAD PRIVATE RACKETS OF THEIR OWN IZZIE WAS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN TO FIND IT OUT AND USED THE INFORMATION WITH A BEAT SUCH AS THAT EVEN GOING HALVES AND WITH ALL THE GRAFT TO THE UPPER BRACKETS HE'D STILL BE ABLE TO MAKE HIS PILE IN A MATTER OF MONTHS
8131-117029-0004  GORDON CAME TO A ROW OF TEMPORARY BUBBLES INDIVIDUAL DWELLINGS BUILT LIKE THE DOME BUT OPAQUE FOR PRIVACY
8131-117017-0029  THE LITTLE GUY KNEW MARS AS FEW OTHERS DID APPARENTLY FROM ALL SIDES
8131-117017-0031  THE CAPTAIN LOOKED COMPLETELY BEATEN AS HE CAME INTO THE ROOM AND DROPPED INTO THE BENCH
8131-117029-0003  CREDIT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED AGAIN AND THE BUSINESSES WERE OPEN
8131-117029-0000  THERE WAS A MAN COMING FROM EARTH ON A SECOND SHIP WHO WOULD SEE HIM
8131-117017-0025  FOR A SECOND IZZIE'S FACE WENT BLANK THEN HE CHUCKLED
8131-117017-0028  THE KID POCKETED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY NODDING
8131-117017-0024  NOW SHOW ME WHERE I SIGNED ANY AGREEMENT SAYING I'D PAY YOU BACK
8131-117017-0027 THANKS IZZIE THANKS YOURSELF
8131-117016-0010  I'VE GOT A FREE HAND AND WE'RE GOING TO RUN THIS THE WAY WE WOULD ON EARTH
8131-117016-0018  HE BEGAN WONDERING ABOUT SECURITY THEN
8131-117016-0017  FOR A SECOND GORDON CURSED HIMSELF
8131-117016-0008  THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM FOR HIM
8131-117016-0019  NOBODY HAD TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0016 TWO YEARS, GORDON ADMITTED
8131-117016-0021  MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT
8131-117016-0031  IF THEY TRIED TO RUN THEY WERE HIT FROM BEHIND IF THEY STOOD STILL THEY WERE CLUBBED CAREFULLY
8131-117016-0032  MURDOCK INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING AND TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0023  GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUB IN HIS HANDS
8461-281231-0020 AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE WHERE RICARD APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
8461-281231-0017  THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER
8461-281231-0025 THE BRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOODS
8461-281231-0027 SO SAYING HE MOUNTED A STRONG WAR HORSE AND RODE AFTER INTO THE FOREST
8461-281231-0015  YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO KNOW
8461-281231-0016  EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND PERISH
8461-281231-0014 TELL ME THY NAME OR WREAK THY PLEASURE ON ME
8461-281231-0013  AT LENGTH DE BRACY FELL
8461-281231-0030 THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FROM DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
8461-281231-0031 HE APPEALED TO DE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN HIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
8131-117016-0020 THERE WAS A CRUDE LIGHTING SYSTEM HERE PUT UP BY THE CITIZENS. AT THE FRONT OF EACH BUILDING, A DIM PHOSPHOR BULB GLOWED. WHEN DARKNESS FELL, THEY WOULD HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO SEE BY
8131-117016-0011  YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS HERE AND THAT MEANS EVERY ONE NOT BREAKING THE LAWS WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE IT OR NOT NO GRAFT
8131-117016-0012  THE FIRST MAN MAKING A SHAKEDOWN WILL GET THE SAME TREATMENT WE'RE GOING TO USE ON THE STONE WALL BOYS YOU'LL GET DOUBLE PAY HERE AND YOU CAN LIVE ON IT
8131-117016-0015  BRUCE GORDON GRINNED SLOWLY AS HE SWUNG THE STICK AND MARDOCK'S EYES FELL ON HIM EARTH COP
8131-117016-0014 THE REST OF YOU CAN TEAM UP ANY WAY YOU WANT TO NIGHT. PICK ANY RACK THAT'S OPEN. OKAY MEN, LET'S GO
8131-117016-0006  THE SHOPKEEPERS AND SOME OF THE LESS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE THERE HAD PROTESTED LOUD ENOUGH TO REACH CLEAR BACK TO EARTH
8131-117016-0013  HE PICKED OUT FIVE OF THE MEN INCLUDING GORDON YOU FIVE WILL COME WITH ME
8131-117016-0005 THEY WERE SAFE FROM PROTECTION RACKETEERS THERE. NONE BOTHERED TO COME SO FAR OUT
8131-117016-0009  GORDON REPORTED FOR WORK WITH A SENSE OF THE BOTTOM FALLING OUT MIXED WITH A VAGUE RELIEF
8131-117016-0007  CAPTAIN MURDOCK WAS AN UNKNOWN FACTOR AND NOW WAS ASKING FOR MORE MEN
8280-266249-0017  IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEWERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS
8280-266249-0022 AND SOME RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0035  HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATEROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0034  NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0042  A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0046 MISTER LILBURN AND MISTER DALY EACH AT A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WARD'S INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE HIM FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0039 THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACKLEG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
8280-266249-0044 I THINK NOT I THINK I DID YOU FROM MESSEN RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045  THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0041  THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8131-117029-0001  THE LITTLE PUBLISHER WAS BACK AT THE CRUSADER AGAIN
8131-117017-0026  HE PULLED OUT THE BILLS AND HANDED THEM OVER
8131-117017-0023 AS HE TURNED IT OVER AND SHOOK HIS HEAD

8131-117029-0007  FAT'S PLACE WAS STILL OPEN THOUGH THE CROOKED TABLES HAD BEEN REMOVED GORDON DROPPED TO A STOOL SLIPPING OFF HIS HELMET
8131-117029-0017  THERE'S A ROCKET WAITING TO TRANSSHIP YOU TO THE MOON ON THE WAY TO MERCURY RIGHT NOW GORDON SIGHED
8461-281231-0033  HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
8461-281231-0038  THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THE SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
8461-281231-0035 THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK AROUND AND TO MARK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
8461-281231-0032 BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LUCAS DE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THEIR PRECEPTORY
8461-281231-0034  POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFICE UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
8461-281231-0028 DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA
8461-281231-0037  AT HIS FEET WAS PLACED THE TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
8461-281231-0036  SHE GAZED ACCORDINGLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
8461-281231-0029 AND WITH THIS EPISTLE THE HAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
8280-266249-0038  I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE FIRST LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME

8280-266249-0037 A VENTRILOQUIST BOARD OF COURSE RETURNED ANOTHER LET'S FOLLOW AND SEE THE FUN
8280-266249-0031  THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
8280-266249-0033 AND THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TOO
8280-266249-0036  WHAT DOES IT MEAN CRIED ONE
8280-266249-0032  NO SIR HE IS NOT THERE
8280-266249-0060  OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALEY SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE
8280-266249-0051  THEY BENT EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOATING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREEN BACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8461-278226-0009  HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
8461-278226-0010 I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MORNING ROOM IN A COSY SPOT
8461-278226-0003  I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES THE MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
8461-258277-0016 HE REPLIED HALF-HEARTEDLY BY THEY ARE IN CAIRO
8461-258277-0014  QUOTH A RASHID WHOSE HEAD IS THIS
8461-278226-0000  AND LAURA HAD HER OWN PET PLANS
8461-281231-0009 THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY THE BRACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
8461-281231-0008  MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
8461-281231-0000  HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THE WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
8461-281231-0001  IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY SADRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE COUNCIL OF TORKILSTONE
8188-269290-0012  I TOOK IT OUT SAID LESLIE TOOK IT OUT
8188-269290-0015  OH I WON'T LOCK YOU OUT SHE SAID BUT I MUST HAVE THE KEY
8188-269290-0018  WHAT CAN THIS MEAN SHE SAID TO HERSELF
8188-269290-0020  OH I SHALL NEVER DO THAT REPLIED LESLIE
8188-269290-0019  OH I WON'T PRESS YOU REPLIED JANE
8188-269290-0006  YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A TRIAL IT IS FOR ME TO HAVE YOU HERE
8188-269290-0016 JANE HERIOT'S VOICE WAS HEARD IN THE PASSAGE
8188-269290-0009 YOU VEX ME BEYOND ENDURANCE
8188-269290-0005  IT BURNED AS IF FOR FEVER
8188-269290-0013  HAVE THE GOODNESS TO FIND IT AND PUT IT BACK
8131-117029-0018  AND I PAID HER THE PAY WE OWE YOU FROM THE TIME YOU BEGAN USING YOUR BADGE SHE'S OUT SHOPPING
8131-117029-0015  LET'S SAY YOU'VE SHIFTED SOME OF THE MISERY AROUND A BIT AND GIVEN THEM A CHANCE TO DO BETTER
8131-117029-0021 I OH DREAD IT I'M GETTING OLD IZZIE YOU TELL HIM
8131-117029-0020 DID YOU THINK WE'D LET YOU GO WITHOUT SIGNING OFF COPPER HE ASKED
8131-117029-0008 HE REACHED AUTOMATICALLY FOR THE GLASS OF EITHER NEEDLE BEER
8131-117029-0013  FINALLY GOT OUR ORDERS FOR YOU IT'S MERCURY
8131-117029-0014  WE SENT TWENTY OTHERS THE SAME WAY AND THEY FAILED
8131-117029-0006  SHOALBERG'S VOLUNTEERS WERE OFFICIAL NOW
8131-117029-0012  THERE WAS A GRIN ON THE OTHER'S FACE
8131-117029-0019  BUT HIS OLD EYES WERE GLINTING
8461-278226-0001 SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED A SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WHETHER NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF CHILDREN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
8461-278226-0005  SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH PEARL GRAY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AZURE BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006  HE WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-258277-0015 SO ALI RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND THE CALIPH SAID I HAD NOT THOUGHT THOU WOULDST KILL HIM FOR THAT HE WAS A SORCERER
8461-258277-0013 SO I WENT ROUND ABOUT THE HIGHWAYS OF THE CITY TILL I MET A SWEETMEAT SELLER AND BOUGHT HIS CLOTHES AND STOCK IN TRADE AND GEAR FOR TEN DINARS DID WHAT WAS DONE
8461-278226-0011 SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ART THEN PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER CRYSTAL LEFT AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
8461-278226-0004 I REMEMBER ALL THE RUBENS' PAINTINGS AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM FOUR YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
8461-278226-0008 PHILIP JOSCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HIS WIFE MADE THIS DISCOVERY
8461-278226-0007  BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE GALLERY
8131-117016-0060  THIS COULD LEAD TO ABUSES AS HE'D SEEN ON EARTH
8131-117017-0004 GUNS SUDDENLY SEEMED TO BE FLOURISHING EVERYWHERE
8131-117017-0006  I'M REFORMED I'M GOING STRAIGHT
8131-117017-0005  YOU CAN'T DO IT TO ME
8131-117017-0008  ONE LOOK WAS ENOUGH THE WORKPAPERS HAD THE TELL TALE OVER THICKENING OF THE SIGNATURE THEY HAD SHOWED UP ON OTHER PAPERS OBVIOUSLY FORGERIES
8131-117017-0017 THE LITTLE MAN SHOOK HIS HEAD HIS ANCIENT EIGHTEEN YEAR OLD FACE TURNING SOBER NOT
8131-117017-0022 GORDON HAD HEARD OF THE FRIENDLY INTEREST CHARGE ON THE SIDE HERE BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD WRONG WAS HE
8131-117017-0009 SOME TURNED AWAY AS GORDON AND THE OTHER COP WENT TO WORK BUT MOST OF THEM WEREN'T SQUEAMISH
8131-117017-0014  WHEN GORDON AND JENKINS CAME BACK MERDOC TOSSED THE MONEY TO THEM SPLIT IT
8131-117017-0020 YOU DIDN'T PAY UP YOUR PLEDGE TO THE CAPTAIN FUND SO I HAD TO FILL IN
8280-266249-0026  AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0023  NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0027  IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DAILY
8280-266249-0018  THAT THE FRENCH POLYTECHNICA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0029  THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0021  AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0030  THEY'RE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0024  FOR YOU ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GODS
8280-266249-0025  WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0019 NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEATHS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEWERS
8280-266249-0013  WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMAN'S CABIN WHERE THERE'S A LIGHT
8280-266249-0012  DOUBTLESS THAT IS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0005  BESIDES OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RANALD LAUGHING
8280-266249-0008 DO YOU THINK? WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009  HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE BOY
8280-266249-0010  SUPPOSE YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANK
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS, ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN. AND A POUND OF TOBACCO, ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY, CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN, SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE, ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO. AND ANY PHYSICIAN, UPON A FEW MOMENTS' REFLECTION, CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LOWBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE OFFEND THEE, PLUCK IT OUT AND CAST IT FROM THEE, FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBERS SHOULD PERISH, AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HELL
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACTED FROM TOBACCO, PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF A DOG, WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE. THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0052  A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0053  BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS TO THE FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0058  THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0050  AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0059  TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DAILIES WERE IN VERY STRAIGHTENED CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LILBURY WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP IN A STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP AT ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED, "TOWARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE BUT YOURSELF"
8280-266249-0047  YET THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSIONS
8280-266249-0062  ELSIE ANSWERED PRESSING HER HAND AFFECTIONATELY ARE WE NOT SISTERS IN CHRIST
8280-266249-0061  AND HOW WONDERFULLY HE HAS ANSWERED OUR PETITIONS
8188-269288-0056  THERE WAS NO REPLY BUT THE SOUND OF HURRYING STEPS CAME QUICKER AND QUICKER NOW AND THEN THEY WERE INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN
8188-269288-0051 SHE TURNED OFF THE LIGHT AND LIT A CANDLE WHICH SHE PUT BEHIND HER SCREEN THEN PREPARED TO GET INTO BED
8188-269290-0004 IT DOESN'T MATTER REPLIED ANNIE WHETHER IT IS AN ORDER OR NOT I'M NOT COMING SEE NOTHING ABOUT ME PLEASE
8188-269290-0001  IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER THAT EVENING LESLIE RAN UP TO HER ROOM TO MAKE PREPARATIONS FOR HER VISIT TO EAST HALL
8188-269288-0053 ANNIE DID NOT MEAN TO CONFIDE IN ANY ONE THAT NIGHT AND THE KINDEST THING WAS TO LEAVE HER ALONE
8188-269288-0057  OH THIS WILL KILL ME MY HEART WILL BREAK THIS WILL KILL ME
8188-269288-0048  SHE GOT INTO BED AS SHE SPOKE AND WRAPPED THE CLOTHES TIGHTLY ROUND HER

8461-281231-0002  AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED WRAPPED WITH PAIN A MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH A FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
8461-278226-0013  BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS
8461-278226-0012 THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE LIMBER CELL THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF OF THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
8461-281231-0011  TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THE LEADER'S EFFORTS TO STOP THEM

8280-266249-0002  THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOUR
8280-266249-0003  AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0014  HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0000  OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001  AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WILL BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT

6432-63723-0028  AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
6432-63723-0019  THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELER WAS TRIED
6432-63723-0015  SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FEE
