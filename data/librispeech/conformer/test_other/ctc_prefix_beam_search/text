1688-142285-0000 THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
1688-142285-0011 ALL HIS FORMERAL FRIENDS SHUN FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO GAIN HIS OWN WARATE PORTION OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0001 MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOPBO
1688-142285-0013 AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISTER THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
1688-142285-0006 I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
1688-142285-0010 HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
1688-142285-0007 I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
1688-142285-0003 I REALLY LIKE THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
1688-142285-0004 HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOPBOY WAS THE THING I LIKE BEST OF ALL
1688-142285-0005 YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPY AT HELSTONE
1688-142285-0008 HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
1688-142285-0009 WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE
1688-142285-0012 NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
1688-142285-0015 HOW TAINT IT ASKED HER FATHER
1688-142285-0002 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
1688-142285-0014 SO THERE LEFT MILTON
1688-142285-0031 ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBERS SOON AFTER DIXON LIFTED AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
1688-142285-0022 JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
1688-142285-0018 AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
1688-142285-0030 SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN A BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS A CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
1688-142285-0024 PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
1688-142285-0017 WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UP UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
1688-142285-0021 MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
1688-142285-0016 O PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
1688-142285-0029 THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SCIENCE OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
1688-142285-0027 I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
1688-142285-0026 PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL
1688-142285-0020 IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
1688-142285-0025 CAN I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
1688-142285-0019 NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
1688-142285-0023 HOWEVER OUT IT CAME
1688-142285-0028 BUT GOOD NIGHT CHILD
1688-142285-0040 I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHINGER NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED OF MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND OF BOOLA AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
1688-142285-0032 BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDEN HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
1688-142285-0034 A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP THE WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTIONS SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
1688-142285-0035 VISITING REGISTER OFFICERS SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
1688-142285-0033 SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THEIR MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
1688-142285-0041 MARGARET TURNED AROUND TO WALK LONGSIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
1688-142285-0045 BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
1688-142285-0036 ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
1688-142285-0038 BETTER AND NOT BETTER IF YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
1688-142285-0039 NOT EXACTLY REPLIED MARGARET SMILING
1688-142285-0043 AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
1688-142285-0044 BESSY DO YOU WISH TO DIE
1688-142285-0042 BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
1688-142285-0046 NOT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
1688-142285-0037 WELL BUSY HOW ARE YOU
1688-142285-0047 BUT WHAT WAS IT
1688-142285-0060 BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
1688-142285-0057 MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
1688-142285-0048 YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE IN MILTON
1688-142285-0052 AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT INTO A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
1688-142285-0056 BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
1688-142285-0051 THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
1688-142285-0053 YOU'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHERS AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GRUFFISH AT FIRST
1688-142285-0050 I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
1688-142285-0049 I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
1688-142285-0063 I DO'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL
1688-142285-0058 REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT TO YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
1688-142285-0059 NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TOO
1688-142285-0054 BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
1688-142285-0061 I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
1688-142285-0062 THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMAN
1688-142285-0055 GASP BESSY AT LAST
1688-142285-0074 I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YOU'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YOU WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
1688-142285-0064 BUT WHOSE COME AT LASTS AND WHOSE WELCOME AS LONG AS WHO WILL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT WHO KNOWS NOTUGHT ABOUT
1688-142285-0073 PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESADDOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
1688-142285-0068 I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MIRPED WITH SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF FATHER IS NOT THERE
1688-142285-0072 MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
1688-142285-0069 THE FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEKS AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE
1688-142285-0065 IT'S SIMPLE ARE NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO WORK
1688-142285-0070 BUT YOU WILL BE THEIR FATHER YOU SHALL OH MY HEART
1688-142285-0071 SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE
1688-142285-0067 DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
1688-142285-0076 MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
1688-142285-0079 NO MAMMA THAT ANNE BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
1688-142285-0066 BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLEADED THE MORE WITH MARGARET
1688-142285-0075 OH COME TO MORROW SAID MARGARET
1688-142285-0078 HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT DEAR

1688-142285-0090 SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
1688-142285-0084 WHY I WOULD APPLY IT TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS
1688-142285-0094 I DON'T KNOW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS HERS EITHER BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHERED FROM HIM I FANCY SO
1688-142285-0087 MISTER THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HALE QUIETLY
1688-142285-0088 I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED

1688-142285-0089 PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
1688-142285-0091 MY DEAR SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PRAY DON'T GO OFF ON THAT IDEA
1688-142285-0095 THEY CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER

3005-163399-0017 CHILDREN DON'T YOU SAY A WORD
3080-5032-0009 MISTER FISH IS A SQUIRE OF DAMES AND HAS SO MANY MISTRESSES THAT ANYBODY MAY PRETEND A SHARE IN HIM AND BEBEL BELIEVEVD THAT THOUGH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHBOUR TO SPEAK FREELY I CANNOT BRAG MUCH THAT HE MAY MAKESS ANY ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
3080-5032-0006 ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REFUSED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE STAGE LIKE RICHARD THE THIRD'S GHOSTS TO REPROACH ME WITH AND ALL THE KINDNESS' DISCOVERIES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHARGE

3080-5032-0011 I CAN NO SOONER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE HINTS WHEREABOUT THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENTLY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEHOLDING TO ME FOR YOUR ACQUAINTANCE
3080-5032-0002 HER CONVERSATION HAS MORE CHARMS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND A HUMOUR AND DISPOSITION WOULD MAKE A DEFORMED PERSON APPEAR LOVELY
3080-5032-0008 TIS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SORRY FOR IT BUT I'LL SWEAR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
3005-163399-0029 BEING TIME SAWYER WAS EASY AND COMFORTABLE AND IT STAYED EASY AND COMFORTABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STEAMBOAT CO ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
3080-5032-0005 IN EARNEST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SKIRMISH AND UPON SO FOOLISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WITCH ARE STRANGERS
3080-5032-0001 I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CHOOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WORST OF HER
3080-5032-0004 WA THE BEST HONOR IS I HAVE A SQUIRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
3005-163399-0030 THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S'POSE TOM SOER COMES DOWN ON NE BOAT
3080-5032-0000 BUT I AM HUGELY PLEASED THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY
3080-5032-0003 WHY DIDN'T YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND A GARLON
3005-163399-0027 I HAIN'T NO IDEA WHO IS IT
3080-5032-0010 I THINK MY YOUNGEST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM
3005-163399-0028 IS TOM SAWYER
3080-5032-0018 WELL IN EARNEST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MISTRESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RULE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LOSING THEIR HEARTS TO HER MAY BE INFINITELY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VALUE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUSTINIAN WISE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUMANS EVERYBODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITHAL WITHOUT ENVYING THEIR NEIGHBORS
3080-5032-0019 THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONFESS I DO NATURALLY HATE THE NOISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASED NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN IT UPON ANY OCCASION WHATSOEVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHOLLY AVOIDED ONE MUST SATISFY ONE'SSELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOWS
3080-5032-0015 I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE'S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH HAS PRETEND AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERSECUTE ME MY DEAR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPTED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HOLLOW TREE TO AVOID THEM
3080-5032-0012 BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EASY ACCESS BUT YOU MAY ACKNOWLEDGE SOMETHING DUE TO ME IF I INCLINE HIM TO LOOK GRACIOUSLY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HARM DONE
3080-5032-0013 I HAVE MISSED FOURFEITS AND HAVE HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECOVERED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VENTURE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WEDNESDAY A MILE FROM HOME
3080-5032-0024 AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OURSELVES WERE INDIFFERENT TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEARNED IT SINCE
3080-5032-0022 I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORMED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOWS UTMOST OF THE INJURIES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
3080-5032-0025 I HAVE BEEN STUDYING HOW TOM'S CHEEK MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELLIGENCE AND I VERY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY COUSIN PETER'S
3080-5032-0021 HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEFYING FORTUNE NOBODY LIVES WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAGINE YOU COULD
3080-5032-0017 IF MARRIAGE AGREES NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAISE THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY ESCAPE IT
3080-5032-0026 HOW KINDLY DO I TAKE THE CIVILITIES OF YOUR FATHERS IN EARNESTN YOU CANNOT IMAGINE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASED ME
3080-5040-0000 WOULD IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
3080-5032-0016 YOU WOULD THINK HIM ALTERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE MELANCHOLY THAN HE WAS
3080-5032-0023 WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DEBATE BUT MUCH MORE CALD ME
3080-5032-0020 IF I HAD A PICTURE THAT WERE FIT FOR YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE IT
3080-5032-0014 BUT BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS
3080-5040-0007 YET IN EARNEST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PEETON WANTING IN CIVILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMPLIMENT UNLESS IT BE IN HIS LETTER TO ME NOR AN UNREASONABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALLOW HIM OUT OF HIS KINDNESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGHER VALUE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DESERVES
3080-5040-0013 IF I DROWN BY THE WAY THIS WILL BE MY LAST LETTER AND LIKE A WILL I BEQUEATH ALL MY KINDNESS TO YOU IN IT WITH A CHARGE NEVER TO BESTOW IT ALL UPON ANOTHER MISTRESS LEST MY GHOST RISE AGAIN AND HAUNT YOU
3080-5040-0004 I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIMPLY AND OUT OF COUNTENANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WEDDING WELL DESIGNED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSONS AT TIME ENOUGH I CONFESS TO CONTRIVE IT AND NOBODY TO PLEASE INTIMATE THEMSELVES
3080-5040-0002 SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VOWS SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHENCE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOLUTIONS ARE AS UNALTERABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY TALMISH
3080-5040-0001 MY POOR LADY VAVASOR IS CARRIED TO THE TOWER AND HER GREAT BELLY COULD NOT EXCUSE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQUAINTED BY SOMEBODY THAT THERE WAS A PLOT AGAINST THE PROTECTOR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
3080-5040-0008 MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER A GONE THAN YESTERDAY THAT I WAS THE MOST WILFUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBSTINACY OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVERCOME TAKE HEED
3080-5040-0014 INDEED I LIKE HIM EXTREMELY AND HE IS COMMENDED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUDGE FOR A MOST EXCELLENT SERVANT AND FAITHFUL AS POSSIBLE
3080-5040-0006 DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD ENDURE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FAIL BUT IN EARNEST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
3080-5040-0010 BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE GONE INTO KENT ANDN MY OTHER JOURNEY IS LAID ASIDE WHICH I AM NOT DISPLEASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN OUR INTERCOURSE VERY MUCH
3080-5040-0005 THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT ENDURE TO BE MISSUS BRIDE IN A PUBLIC WEDDING BE MADE THE HAPPIEST PERSON ON EARTH
3080-5040-0015 BECAUSE YOU FIND FAULT WITH MY OTHER LETTERS THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORTER THAN THEY I DID NOT INTEND IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASSURE YOU
3080-5040-0012 I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST THAT MY SUFFLED JOURNEY WAS LAID ASIDE AND THAT INTO KENT HASTENED
3080-5040-0016 I DO NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXTREMELY WHEN I BELIEVED YOU LOVE ME
3080-5040-0011 HERE ARE SOME VERSES OR COLONIIES TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE THEM
3080-5040-0003 I WONDER HOW SHE BEHAVED HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MARRIED
3080-5040-0009 YOU SEE I GIVE YOU FOR WARNING
3080-5040-0025 THEY LAUGH TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UNKIND WORD WOULD DESTROY ALL THE SATISFACTION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KINDNESS SHOULD INCREASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESSON
3080-5040-0019 I SEE YOU CAN CHID WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHORITY BUT I DESERVE IT I CONFESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FAULT PROCEEDED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCIPLE IN ME
3080-5040-0032 IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RIDICULOUS A DISCOURSE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASSES FOR A WITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PUZZLED TO SEEK WHAT TO SAY TO REASONABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
3080-5040-0022 BUT I AM TROUBLED MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOURNEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WRIT BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRIVAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAGINE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTERS
3080-5040-0029 HE HAS ONE SON AND TIS THE FINEST BOY THAT ERE' YOU SAW AND HAS A NOBLE SPIRIT BUT YET STANDS IN THAT AWE OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WHIPPINGS
3080-5040-0024 FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BEAT INTO THEIR HEADS A PASSION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DECAY AN EVEN PERFECT KINDNESS THAT MUST LAST PERPETUALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION
3080-5040-0031 NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASSURE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A COUSIN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DESIGNED TO MAKE HERSELF SPORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF HER AIM
3080-5040-0027 WHILE IN SOBER EARNEST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TWELVE MONTHTHS TO GAIN ALL THAT KING HAS LOST UNLESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
3080-5040-0030 YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTERTAIN YOU THU WITH DISCOURSES OF A FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HENCE
3080-5040-0020 WE DARE NOT LET OUR TONGUES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOSTS THAN THE OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVERTURNING IT
3080-5040-0026 WE GOBROAD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAY IS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
3080-5040-0021 YOU ARE SATISFIED I HOPE AT THIS THAT I ESCAPE DROWNING
3080-5040-0023 HOW WELCOME YOU WILL BE BUT ALAS
3080-5040-0018 DIRECTED FOR YOUR MASTER
3080-5040-0028 WILL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURED
3080-5040-0017 BUT I AM CALLED UPON
3331-159605-0008 NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THE WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANTED LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOUR OF ROMANS INTO HER DARK HARD WORKING DAYS
3080-5040-0033 EVER SINCE'S ADVENTURE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIEF IN ALL THINGS WITH THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FORBEAR LAYING A PEASECOT WITH NINE PEAS INTO UNDER MY DOOR YESTERDAY IT WAS INFORMED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND'S NAME SHOULD BE THOMAS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
3331-159605-0000 SHE PUTED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HIS GIURT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK POTTER UNDER INTO HER LAP ALL OF ITS ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
3331-159605-0013 AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
3331-159605-0009 I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH THE ACCOMPLISHMENT'S OPPOSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
3331-159605-0014 PARTLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE FITTES THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
3331-159605-0010 IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED OF WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
3331-159605-0011 THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIGHT OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
3331-159605-0012 LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLUTTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
3331-159605-0002 I'VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF DEAD NIGHT'S FUN
3331-159605-0003 JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
3331-159605-0005 I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR AUGHT AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOYE THAT
3331-159605-0007 HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
3331-159605-0006 LET MISS C HOW CAN I BEGIN
3331-159605-0001 THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE CREDITED
3331-159605-0004 WHAT A SPITEFUL THING I AM
3331-159605-0029 SO WHEN SHE MADE A LAST BOY AND REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I'M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOU LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOY IT
3331-159605-0030 SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND DRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WHITE LIKE LOVELY
3331-159605-0020 HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER TILL SHE HAD NOT THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
3331-159605-0015 THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECIION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUY'S PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH THE SPIES OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
3331-159605-0024 BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOESN IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEN HER THOUGHTS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
3331-159605-0016 WHEN SET IT CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR VISIT TO BACKY AND BESS BUT COULDN NOT RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHORES TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FAN THAT IT WAS CALLING TIME
3331-159605-0028 HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS WE OFF TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
3331-159605-0019 AT A STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOLPOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURROUND
3331-159605-0017 A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DARK BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GUR TRYING TO HER DUTY
3331-159605-0021 SHE REALLY COULD NOT HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
3331-159605-0018 TAKE HOLD OF MASS CHARLIE'S HAND MISS MAMMY AND WALK PRETTY LIKE BILL AND FLOSSIE SAID THE MAT
3331-159605-0023 SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
3331-159605-0027 ASKED THE ART FOR YOUNG MEN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
3331-159605-0026 HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
3331-159605-0022 THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE RO ANSWERED POLLY
3331-159605-0025 THANK YOU NO
3331-159605-0032 POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVOURITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FOR MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAYS SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
3331-159605-0031 HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPT IN SILENCE
3331-159605-0043 HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO THEN THINK HIS HEART IS BROKEN OR MIND WHAT DID TATTLERS SAY
3331-159605-0036 MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE BOTTLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS
3331-159605-0046 I'M NOT YOU KNOW AND PREFER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT SPINSTER AND TEACH MUSIC ALL MY DAYS
3331-159605-0037 NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS NOT HE PROPOSED
3331-159605-0041 WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
3331-159605-0033 WORKING TO AND FOUR AS USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
3331-159605-0045 BUT POLLY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
3331-159605-0044 HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A GENTLEMAN MADE NO FUS
3331-159605-0040 I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I WIGGLY THOUGHT HE DID
3331-159605-0035 UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
3331-159605-0042 I JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT
3331-159605-0039 TRULY JULIELY FAN
3331-159605-0038 DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
3331-159605-0034 PERHAPS SHE CHILLED HIM
3331-159609-0014 IT WAS HER TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER AND ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIEND'S BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVER AS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARY
3331-159609-0000 NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICS TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOWN WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
3331-159609-0001 FORTUNATELY EVERY EVERYONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANS OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BUTTERED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
3331-159609-0002 PITY THAT THE END COMES SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WHENND ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THAT THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WITH DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
3331-159609-0003 IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUM IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TO HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCES WITH POLLY BEGUARD THE LONG DAYS
3331-159609-0011 NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELL HER FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE A HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
3331-159609-0004 TOM WERE AT ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
3331-159609-0006 FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR THIS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
3331-159609-0015 I HOPE MARI BAY IS AL HE THINKS SIR SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD NOT BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
3331-159609-0005 NOW I'M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAR TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST TO TRAVEL BLUE
3331-159609-0012 ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF CHOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
3331-159609-0007 I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
3331-159609-0010 POOR PAULLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
3331-159609-0009 CRIED POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
3331-159609-0013 IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE
3331-159609-0008 THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
3331-159609-0020 IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
3528-168656-0002 EVERY YEAR SHE SOLEMNLY RENEWED HER VOWS AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE OATH SHE SAID TO THE PRIEST MONSEIGNEUR SAINT FROTOOIS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN MONSEIGNEUR SAINT JULIAN GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT USSIBIUS MONSEIGNEUR SAINT EUSSEIUS GAVE IT TO MONSEIGNEUR SAINT PROCOPIUS ET CETERA ET CETERA
3331-159609-0021 SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FUNNING IT PLEASANT AT IS THE DREAMING OF A BOOK OR SOON ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHORES
3528-168656-0003 AND THE SCHOOLGIRS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLEEVES BUT UNDER THEIR VEILS CHARMING LITTLE STIFLED LAUGHS WHICH MADE THE VOCAL MOTHERS FROWN
3331-159609-0024 THEN CAME BOGGING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE POOR TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
3331-159609-0017 SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE'S ANYTHING TO TELL
3331-159609-0025 BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL ST STORIEYS MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
3331-159609-0018 BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO PAIR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
3331-159609-0022 POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WIND AND THOSE NEARS TO HER SO INVITEDED EDWARD IT MOST
3331-159609-0023 FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN OTHER DARKNESS
3528-168656-0004 IT WAS A CENTURY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY
3528-168656-0001 IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VANITY TO DRAG IN THESE NAMES ON EVERY PRETEXT
3331-159609-0019 IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINDOW FROM THE LAST ABOVE THE GIRLS
3528-168656-0005 THE RULE OF FANREVAL DID NOT FORBID THIS
3528-168656-0000 SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCIETY BEFORE THE REVOLUTION
3331-159609-0016 SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
3528-168656-0011 HE IS RESISTING FLUTTERING HIS TINY WINGS AND STILL MAKING AN EFFORT TO FLY BUT THE DANCERS IS LAUGHING WITH A SATANICAL AIR
3528-168656-0010 WHEN THE POOR OLD WOMAN DIED THEY RUSHED TO HER CUPBOARD MORE HASTILY THAN WAS FITTING PERHAPS AND OPENED IT
3528-168656-0007 THUS IT FURNISHED A SUBJECT OF COMMENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UNOCCUPIED OR BORED IN THE CONVENT
3528-168669-0001 WE WILL PRESENT A STENOGRAPHICAL REPORT OF THE DIALOGUE WHICH THEN ENSUED TO THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY
3528-168669-0004 AND YOU HAVE BEEN IN THE CHOIR AND PURSUANCE OF YOUR DUTIES TWO OR THREE TIMES

3528-168656-0008 SOME UNIQUE CHAPLET SOME AUTHENTIC RELIC
3528-168656-0012 MORAL LOVE CONQUERED BY THE COLIC
3528-168669-0008 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING TO HAVE TWO MEN FOR IT
3528-168656-0009 THEY LOST THEMSELVES IN CONJECTURES
3528-168656-0006 SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THE SUBJECT TO ANY ONE

3528-168669-0096 ONE NO LONGER KNOWS WHAT IS DUE TO THE LIVING OR TO THE DEAD A HOLY DEATH IS PROHIBITED
3528-168669-0095 BY ORDER OF THE KING SIGNIFIES TO DAY BY ORDER OF THE REVOLUTION
3528-168669-0102 BESIDES WHAT THE CLOISTER KNOWS THE WORLD LEARNS NOT
3528-168669-0092 THEY SHUT THEIR EYES TO THE TRUTH DARKNESS IS THE RULE
3528-168669-0098 THE PRIRESS TOOK BREATH THEN TURNED TO FAUCHELEVENT
3528-168669-0093 THE MOST FEROCIOUS BEASTS ARE BEASTS WHICH ARE BLIND

3528-168669-0107 THE PEAL WHICH ORDERS THE DOCTOR FOR THE DEBT TO BE SUMMONED HAS ALREADY BEEN RUNG
3528-168669-0116 EVERYTHING MUST HAVE BEEN COMPLETED A GOOD QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE THAT

3528-168669-0106 HE WILL PAY IT AT FOUR O'CLOCK TO DAY
3528-168669-0109 THAT IS WELL FATHER FERVENN
3528-168669-0110 WHERE WILL YOU OBTAIN IT
3538-142836-0004 IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SURF AND APPLI TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SURF WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
3538-142836-0001 THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS SUBJECTION FOR EXCEPT A SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUALITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
3538-142836-0003 BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
3538-142836-0002 FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MOULDED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
3538-142836-0000 JA OBSERVATIONS ON PRESERVES CONFECTIONERY ISS AND DESSERT DISHES
3538-142836-0005 LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
3528-168669-0129 I WILL PUT EARTH IN THE COFFIN REVERED MOTHER THAT WILL PRODUCE THE EFFECT OF A CORPSE
3528-168669-0128 HE MADE HASTE TO IMPROVISE AN EXPEDIENT TO MAKE HER FORGET THE OATH
3528-168669-0126 AH LIDA EXCLAIMED FAUCHELEVENT
3528-168669-0123 THE EMPTY COFFIN REMAINS THIS PRODUCED A PAUSE
3528-168669-0125 IT WILL BE GIVEN TO THE EARTH EMPTY
3528-168669-0127 THE VI STUCK FAST IN HIS THROAT
3528-168669-0124 WHAT IS TO BE DONE WITH THAT COFFIN FATHER PREVENT
3528-168669-0121 AFTER WHICH THERE WILL BE NO TRACE OF ANYTHING
3528-168669-0130 I WILL MAKE THAT MY SPECIAL BUSINESS
3528-168669-0122 THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE NO SUSPICION
3538-142836-0019 IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONERY SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOF AND JUICES WHICH ONE BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFIREY TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONERY EMBRACES OF VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY QUASZINE
3538-142836-0017 IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIBUTE UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
3538-142836-0010 THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
3538-142836-0015 MARMALS AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FOR EACH OTHER THEIR PRESERVES OF HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS I SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINEDS WITH SUGAR
3538-142836-0012 THEY SHOULD BE DRIVEED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SEA AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY TURNED
3538-142836-0020 THE THOUSAND AND WARM ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
3538-142836-0021 HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGN OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGEES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DES
3538-142836-0007 BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERV OF MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
3538-142836-0009 BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
3538-142836-0014 MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PAICE SERVE THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
3538-142836-0016 THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT AS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
3538-142836-0006 IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
3538-142836-0011 FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUIT BY SERP WOULD BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
3538-142836-0013 IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMONSHIPS ARE PRESERVED
3538-142836-0018 CONFECTIONERY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
3538-142836-0008 FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
3538-163619-0001 FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MEN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHEN THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
3538-142836-0026 THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING OF THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
3538-163619-0009 ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
3538-163619-0004 WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FETTERS AND COULD NOT STIR FROM THE SPOT FOR THE PICTURE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
3538-142836-0022 THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
3538-163619-0007 WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN'S DAUGHTER AND SHE FLUNG HER CASKET INTO THE SEA
3538-163619-0010 SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
3538-163619-0005 THESE PROMISED TO MAKE ALL THE HASTE HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING'S PALACE
3538-142836-0024 AT DESERTSS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
3538-163619-0000 THERE WAS ONCE TILL THE TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
3538-142836-0025 THE SPAT IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
3538-163619-0002 BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE
3538-163619-0008 WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
3538-163619-0006 AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND
3538-163619-0003 KISS ME GO SAID THE HEAD
3538-142836-0023 ICES
3538-163619-0013 THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
3538-163619-0011 OUT ON THE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIIED AND UNWEPT
3538-163622-0006 WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOOLS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY CLEF IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH THE DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
3538-163619-0014 NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE I GET A QUEEN WHO IS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
3538-163622-0011 THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDER LAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
3538-163622-0008 THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOLDS WERE WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
3538-163622-0002 HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
3538-163622-0005 THE MAKING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
3538-163622-0004 HE HAD GONE AT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
3538-163622-0001 THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WASH THE HOLES AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL WELL AND
3538-163622-0009 SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THAT LIVELONG DAY
3538-163619-0012 I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
3538-163622-0007 COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
3538-163622-0000 WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOLDS ASKED THE KING
3538-163622-0010 ON THE THIRD DAY SAID THE LAD WANTED TO SET OUT
3538-163622-0003 YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
3538-163622-0018 SIDNER LAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
3538-163622-0019 FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EVEN DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTYCHHOLLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
3538-163624-0002 BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED
3538-163624-0001 THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND THOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
3538-163622-0015 WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163624-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
3538-163622-0020 WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FULL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING
3538-163622-0013 I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDER LAD
3538-163622-0022 NOW THEN SAID THE FOAL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
3538-163622-0023 THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
3538-163622-0016 YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAIDZCINDER LAD
3538-163622-0014 AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
3538-163622-0021 AND NOW INQUIRED FULL SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
3538-163622-0012 I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID CINDER LAD
3538-163622-0017 IT LOOKS LIKE THE CHALK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
3538-163622-0024 I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED SILVER THE LAD
3538-163624-0011 THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON HAD MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
3538-163624-0012 BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CALLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAHAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
3538-163624-0003 SO ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WEARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
3538-163624-0018 THEIR SIGURD ROASTING FASTER'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM

3538-163624-0009 THEN SIGURD WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BROKEN PIECES OF HIS FATHER'S BLADE AND GAVE THEM TO REGAN

367-293981-0012 SANCHO PANZA WHO ALSO REGARDED THE AMENDMENT OF HIS MASTER AS MIRACULOUS BEGGED HIM TO GIVE HIM WHAT WAS LEFT IN A PIGSKIN WHICH WAS NO SMALL QUANTITY
367-293981-0013 DON QUIXOTE CONSENTED AND HE TAKING IT WITH BOTH HANDS IN GOOD FAITH AND WITH A BETTER WILL GULPED IT DOWN AND DRAINED OFF VERY LITTLE LESS THAN HIS MASTER
367-293981-0019 HE SAW HIM RISING AND FALLING IN THE AIR WITH SUCH GRACE AND NIMBLENESS THAT HAD HIS RAGE ALLOW HIM IT IS MY BELIEF HE WOULD HAVE LEFT
367-293981-0008 MIKE COULD SPEAK TOO SAID DON QUIXOTE BUT THAT IS NOT A SUSPICION REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT WHAT WE SEE IS THE ENCHANTED MORE
367-293981-0014 IF YOUR WORSHIP KNEW THAT RETURNED SANCHO WOE' BETIDE ME AND ALL MY KINDRED WHY DID YOU LET ME TASTE IT
367-293981-0007 IF THEY DO NOT LET THEMSELVES BE SEEN THEY LET THEMSELVES BE FELT SAID SANCHO IF NOT LET MY SHOULDERS SPEAK TO THE POINT
367-293981-0006 IT CANNOT BE THE MORE ANSWERED DON QUIXOTE FOR THOSE UNDER ENCHANTMENT DO NOT LET THEMSELVES BE SEEN BY ANY ONE
367-293981-0009 THE OFFICERS TURNED ROOM AND SAID WELL HOW GOES A GOOD MAN
367-293981-0016 THEN THIS IS AN INN SAID DON QUIXOTE
367-293981-0017 IN A VERY RESPECTABLE ONE SAID THE INNKEEPER
3764-168670-0015 THAT THE NUN WHO HAD DIED THAT MORNING HAD REQUESTED TO BE BURIED IN THE COFFIN WHICH HAD SERVED HER FOR A BED AND INTERRED IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CHAPEL
3764-168670-0014 THEN HE EXPLAINED TO JEAN VALJEAN THAT THIS WAS HIS RECOMPENSE FOR A SERVICE WHICH HE FAUCHELEVENT WAS TO RENDER TO THE COMMUNITY
3764-168670-0005 I HAVE PERMISSION TO BRING YOU IN BUT BEFORE BRINGING YOU IN YOU MUST BE GOT OUT
3764-168670-0016 THAT THE PRIORRESSS AND THE VOCAL MOTHERS INTENDED TO FULFIL THE WISH OF THE DECEASED
3764-168670-0011 JEAN VALJEAN STARED HIM STRAIGHT IN THE EYE AND THOUGHT THAT HE WAS RAVING
3764-168670-0013 IT IS TO MORROW THAT I AM TO BRING YOU IN THE PRIORRESS EXPECTS YOU
3764-168670-0003 YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME AT A LADY'S HOUSE I SHALL COME TO FETCH YE
3764-168670-0004 EVERYTHING IS RANGED AND NOTHING IS SAID FAUCHELEVENT
3764-168670-0007 IT IS EASY ENOUGH WITH THE CHILD YOU WILL CARRY HER OUT
3764-168670-0009 FAUCHELEVENT GRUMBLED MORE TO HIMSELF THAN TO JEAN VALJEAN
3764-168670-0010 YOU UNDERSTAND FATHER MADELINE THE GOVERNMENT WILL NOTICE IT
3764-168670-0008 AND SHE WILL HOLD HER TONGUE I ANSWER FOR THAT
3764-168670-0002 JEAN VALJEAN HAD PLACED HER NEAR THE FIRE
3764-168670-0006 THAT'S WHERE THE DIFFICULTY LIES
3764-168670-0001 COSETTE HAD WAKED UP
3764-168670-0012 FAUCHELEVENT WENT ON
3764-168670-0028 IT IS A CHAMBER ON THE GROUND FLOOR WHICH HAS A GRATED WINDOW OPENING ON THE GARDEN WHICH IS CLOSED ON THE OUTSIDE BY A SHUTTER AND TWO DOORS ONE LEADS INTO THE CONVENT THE OTHER INTO THE CHURCH A WATCH CHURCH
3764-168670-0031 NO I HAVE THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CONVENT THE PORTER HAS THE KEY TO THE DOOR WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH THE CHURCH
3764-168670-0017 THAT HE FORUCHELEVENT WAS TO NAIL UP THE COFFIN IN THE CELL RAISE THE STONE IN THE CHAPEL AND BLOW THE CORPSE INTO THE VAULT
3764-168670-0022 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS SEATED SPRANG UP AS THOUGH A BALM HAD BURST UNDER HIS CHAIR YOU
3764-168670-0018 AND THEN THAT THERE WAS ANOTHER THE EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0023 YOU KNOW FORTUNEEVAL WHAT YOU HAVE SAID MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IS DEAD
3764-168670-0026 THIS OFFERS THE MEANS BUT GIVE ME SOME INFORMATION IN THE FIRST PLACE
3764-168670-0024 AND I ADD AND FATHER MADELEINE IS BURIED
3764-168670-0029 THE CHURCH IN THE STREET THAT THE CHURCH WHICH ANY ONE CAN ENTER
3764-168670-0032 ONLY TO ALLOW THE UNDERTAKERS MEN TO ENTER WHEN THEY COME TO GET THE COFFIN
3764-168670-0025 YOU ARE NOT LIKE OTHER MEN FATHER MADELEINE
3764-168670-0027 HOW LONG IS THE COFFIN SIX FEET
3764-168670-0020 ASKED JEAN VALJEAN FAUCHELEVENT REPLIED
3764-168670-0021 WHAT COFFIN WHAT ADMINISTRATION
3764-168670-0030 HAVE YOU THE KEYS TO THOSE TWO DOORS
3764-168670-0019 WHAT IS THAT EMPTY COFFIN
3764-168670-0045 TO HAVE HIMSELF NAILED UP IN A CASE AND CARRIED OFF LIKE A BARRELE OF GOODS TO LIVE FOR A LONG TIME IN A BOX TO FIND AIR WHERE THERE IS NONE TO ECONOMIZE HIS BREATH FOR HOURS TO KNOW HOW TO STIFLE WITHOUT DYING THIS WAS ONE OF JEAN VALJEAN'S GLOOMY TALENTS
3764-168670-0046 YOU SURELY MUST HAVE A GIMLET YOU WILL MAKE A FEW HOLES HERE AND THERE AROUND MY MOUTH AND YOU WILL NAIL THE TOP PLANCON LOOSELY GOOD AND WHAT IF YOU SHOULD HAPPEN TO COUGH OR TO SNEEZE
3764-168670-0043 ANY MAN WHO HAS BEEN A PRISONER UNDERSTANDS HOW TO CONTRACT HIMSELF TO FIT THE DIAMETER OF THE ESCAPE
3764-168670-0035 NOT ANOTHER MAN EXCEPT THE POLICE DOCTOR CAN ENTER THE DEAD ROOM THAT IS EVEN WRITTEN ON THE WALL
3764-168670-0040 FAUCHELEVEN RECOILED AND CRACKED HIS FINGER JOINTS BUT THAT IS IMPOSSIBLE
3764-168670-0041 BAH IMPOSSIBLE TO TAKE A HAMMER AND DRIVE SOME NAILS IN A PLANK
3764-168670-0036 COULD YOU HIDE ME IN THAT ROOM TO NIGHT WHEN ONE IS ASLEEP
3764-168670-0047 A MAN WHO IS MAKING HIS ESCAPE DOES NOT COUGH OR SNEEZE
3764-168670-0048 WHO IS THERE WHO HAS NOT SAID TO A CAT DO COME IN
3764-168670-0042 JEAN VALJEAN HAD BEEN IN WORSE STRAIT THAN THIS
3764-168670-0038 I SHALL BE HUNGRY OH I WILL BRING YOU SOMETHING
3764-168670-0044 WHAT DOES NOT A MAN UNDERGO FOR THE SAKE OF A CURE
3764-168670-0039 YOU CAN COME AND NAIL ME UP IN THE COFFIN AT TWO O'CLOCK
3764-168670-0033 WHO NAILS UP THE COFFIN I DO
3764-168670-0037 ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON
3764-168670-0034 WHO SPREADS THE POOL OVER IT
3764-168671-0000 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY AS THE SUN WAS DECLINING THE VERY RARE PASSERS BY ON THE BOULEVARDI MEN PULLED OFF THEIR HATS TO AN OLD FASHIONED HEARSE ORNAMENTED WITH SKULLS CROSS BONES AND TEARS
3764-168671-0001 THIS HEARSE CONTAINED A COFFIN COVERED WITH A WHITE CLOTH OVER WHICH SPREAD A LARGE BLACK CROSS LIKE A HUGE CORPSE WITH DROOPING ARMS
3764-168671-0004 THE GRAVE DIGGERS BEING THUS BOUND TO SERVICE IN THE EVENING IN SUMMER AND AT NIGHT IN WINTER IN THIS CEMETERY THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO A SPECIAL DISCIPLINE
3764-168671-0005 THESE GATES THEREFORE SWUNG INEXORABLY ON THEIR HINGES AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE SUN DISAPPEARED BEHIND THE DOME OF THE INVALID
3764-168670-0049 THE OVERPRUDENT CATS AS THEY ARE AND BECAUSE THEY ARE CATS SOMETIMES INCUR MORE DANGER THAN THE AUDACIOUS
3764-168670-0052 AN OLD FELLOW OF THE OLD SCHOOL THE GRAVE DIGGER PUTS THE CORPSES IN THE GRAVE AND I PUT THE GRAVE DIGGER IN MY POCKET
3764-168671-0002 A MORNING COACH IN WHICH COULD BE SEEN A PRIEST IN HIS SURPLICE AND A CHOIR BOY IN HIS RED CAP FOLLOWED
3764-168670-0055 THE PRIESTS AS THE PRAYERS MAKES THE SIGN OF THE CROSS SPRINKLES THE HOLY WATER AND TAKES HIS DEPARTURE
3764-168671-0003 BEHIND IT CAME AN OLD MAN IN THE GARMENTS OF A LABORER WHO LIMPED ALONG
3764-168670-0050 BUT JEAN VALJEAN'S COOLNESS PREVAILED OVER HIM IN SPITE OF HIMSELF HE GRUMBLED
3764-168670-0054 THE HOUSE HALTTS THE UNDERTAKER'S MEN NOT A ROPE AROUND YOUR COFFIN AND LOWER YOU DOWN
3764-168670-0056 ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER
3764-168670-0051 IF YOU ARE SURE OF COMING OUT OF THE COFFIN ALL RIGHT I AM SURE OF GETTING YOU OUT WITH GRAVE
3764-168671-0006 DAMPNESS WAS INVADING IT THE FLOWERS WERE DESERTING IT
3764-168670-0057 THAT IS SETTLED FATHER FAUCHELEVENT ALL WILL GO WELL
3764-168670-0053 I SHALL FOLLOW THAT IS MY BUSINESS
3764-168671-0009 THE INTERMENT OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION IN THE VAULT UNDER THE ALTAR THE EXIT OF COSETTE THE INTRODUCTION OF JEAN VALJEAN INTO THE DEAD ROOMUM ALL HAD BEEN EXECUTED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY AND THERE HAD BEEN NO HITCH LET US REMARK IN PASSING THAT THE BURIAL OF MOTHER CRUCIFIXION UNDER THE ALTAR OF THE CONVENT IS A PERFECTLY VENAL OFF OFFENCEE IN OUR SIGHT
3764-168671-0012 IN THE CLOISTER WHAT IS CALLED THE GOVERNMENT IS ONLY AN INTER MEDDLING WITH AUTHORITY AN INTERFERENCE WHICH IS ALWAYS QUESTIONABLE
3764-168671-0007 THE BOURGEOIS DID NOT CARE MUCH ABOUT BEING BURIED IN THE ROJAHARS IT HINTED AT POVERTY AT LACHES IF YOU PLEASE
3764-168671-0008 TO BE BURIED IN PARALLASHES IS EQUIVALENT TO HAVING FURNITURE OF MAHOGANY IT IS RECOGNIZED AS ELEGANT
3764-168671-0021 HE WAS A SORT OF LABOURING MAN WHO WORE A WAISTCOAT WITH LARGE POCKETS AND CARRIED A MATTOCK UNDER HIS ARM
3764-168671-0011 THE NUNS HAD COMMITTED IT NOT ONLY WITHOUT DIFFICULTY BUT EVEN WITH THE APPLAUSE OF THEIR OWN CONSCIENCES
3764-168671-0016 JEAN VALJEAN'S COMPOSURE WAS ONE OF THOSE POWERFUL TRANQUILLTIES WHICH ARE CONTAGIOUS
3764-168671-0015 FAUCHELEVENT LIMPED ALONG BEHIND THE HEARSE IN A VERY CONTENTED FRAME OF MIND
3764-168671-0013 MAKE AS MANY LAWS AS YOU PLEASE MEN BUT KEEP THEM FOR YOURSELVES
3764-168671-0019 HE DID WHAT HE LIKED WITH HIM HE MADE HIM DANCE ACCORDING TO HIS WHIM
3764-168671-0014 A PRINCE IS NOTHING IN THE PRESENCE OF A PRINCIPLE
3764-168671-0022 THE MAN REPLIED THE GRAVE DIGGER
3764-168671-0020 THE PERMISSION FOR INTERMENT MUST BE EXHIBITED
3764-168671-0010 IT IS ONE OF THE FAULTS WHICH RESEMBLE A DUTY
3764-168671-0017 WHAT REMAINED TO BE DONE WAS A MERE NOTHING
3764-168671-0018 HE PLAYED WITH FATHER MESIAN
3764-168671-0037 FAUCHELEVENT WHO WAS ILLITERATE BUT VERY SHARP UNDERSTOOD THAT HE HAD TO DEAL WITH A FORMIDABLE SPECIES OF MAN WITH A FINE TALKER HE MUTTERED
3764-168671-0029 BUT HE PERSISTED FEEBLY FATHER MEIAN IS THE GRAVE TIGGGER
3764-168671-0026 FACHELE WHAT HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING BUT THIS BUT A GRAVE DIGGER COULD DIE
3764-168671-0025 FATHER MISS CHAIR IS THE GRAVEDIGGER HE WAS
3764-168671-0027 IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT GRAVE DIGGERS DO DIE THEMSELVES
3764-168671-0030 DO YOU KNOW WHO LITTLE FATHER LAW IS HE IS A JUG OF WE WINE
3764-168671-0032 ARE YOU NOT COMRADE WE'LL GO AND HAVE A DRINK TOGETHER PRESENT
3764-168671-0036 FAUCHELEVENT PASSED THE UNEXPECTED CRAVIER ONCE MORE IN REVIEW
3764-168671-0034 HE LIMPED MORE OUT OF ANXIETY THAN FROM INFIMITY
3764-168671-0023 THE GRAVE DIGGER YES
3764-168671-0024 YOU I
3764-168671-0038 MISS OWN FATHER MASSIE AND IS DEAD
3764-168671-0035 THE GRAVEDIGGER WALKED ON IN FRONT OF HIM
3764-168671-0028 HE HAD HARDLY THE STRENGTH TO STAMMER
3764-168671-0031 BUT YOU'RE A JOLLY FELLOW TOO
3764-168671-0033 THE MAN REPLIED
3764-168671-0040 THE GOOD GOD CONSULTED HIS NOTEKBOOK WHICH SHOWS WHEN THE TIME IS UP IT WAS FATHER MAIAN'S TURN FATHER MUSTIAN DIED
3764-168671-0048 BUT HE HAD REVERSES HE HAD LOSSES ON CHANGE I WAS OBLIGED TO RENOUNCE THE PROFESSION OF AUTHOR BUT I AM STILL A PUBLIC WRITER
3764-168671-0052 A FACHELEVENT WHATEVER HIS ANGUISH OFFERED A DRINK BUT HE DID NOT EXPLAIN HIMSELF ON ONE POINT WHO WAS TO PAY
3764-168671-0046 FORTUNATELY THE SOIL WHICH WAS LIGHT AND WET WITH THE WINTER RAINS CLOGGED THE WHEELS ANDT RETIRED ITS SPEED
3764-168671-0044 THERE WERE ONLY A FEW TURNS OF THE WHEEL DISTANT FROM THE SMALL ALLEY LEADING TO THE NUN'S CORNER
3764-168671-0045 AND HE ADDED WITH THE SATISFACTION OF A SERIOUS MAN WHO IS TURNING A PHRASE WELL
3764-168671-0050 RETURNED FAUCHELEVENT CLUTCHING AT THIS BRANCH FEEBLE AS IT WAS
3764-168671-0047 MY FATHER WAS A PORTER AT THE PRETINUM TOWNHON
3764-168671-0043 FORCHI ALL THOUGHT I AM LOST
3764-168671-0042 YOU ARE A PEASANT I AM THE PARISIAN
3764-168671-0053 THE GRAVEDIGGER WENT ON WITH A SUPERIOR SMILE
3764-168671-0041 STAMMERED FAUCHELEVENT IT IS MADE
3764-168671-0039 THE MAN REPLIED COMPLETELY
3764-168671-0051 HERE A REMARK BECOMES NECESSARY
3764-168671-0049 BUT SO YOU ARE NOT A GRAVE DIGGGGER THEN
3764-168671-0054 ONE MUST EAT
3997-180294-0007 EDUCATION FAMILY FEELING A SENSE OF DUTY THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENTINELS BUT THERE ARE NO SENTINELS SO VIGILANT AS NOT TO BE DECEIVED BY A GIRL OF SIXTEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVES GIVES THE FIRST COUNCIL OF LOVE ALL THE MORE ARDENT BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PURE
3997-180294-0008 THE MORE GIRL BELIEVES IN GOODNESS THE MORE EASILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVER AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MISTRUST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRIUMPH THAT CAN BE GAINED BY ANY YOUNG MEN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCHED AND GUARDED
3997-180294-0009 THEN HOW SURELY MUST THEY DESIRE THE WORLD WHICH IS HIDDEN FROM THEM HOWLY MUST THEY FIND IT TEMPTING HOW SURELY MUST THEY LISTEN TO THE FIRST VOICE WHICH COMES TO TELL ITS SECRETS THROUGH THEIR BARS AND BLESS THE HAND WHICH IS THE FIRST TO RAISE A CORNER OF THE MYSTERY VEIL
3997-180294-0012 WHEN A CREATURE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REPROACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROFOUND SINCERE IRRESISTIBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAPABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONFESSED HER LOVE HOW ABSOLUTELY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES DOMINATES HER
3997-180294-0006 IT SEEMED TO ME AS IF THIS SLEEPING CITY BELONGS TO ME I SEARCHED MY MEMORY FOR THE NAMES OF THOSE WHOSE HAPPINESS I HAD ONCE ENVIED AND I COULD NOT RECALL ONE WITHOUT FINDING MYSELF THE HAPPIER
3997-180294-0014 IN ORDER TO DISTURB THE LABORERS IN THE FIELDS WAS ONE DAY DEVOURED BY A WOLF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DECEIVED NO LONGER BELIEVED IN HIS CRIES FOR HELP
3997-180294-0010 WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WORN OUT THE SOUL THE SENSES HALF BURNED UP THE HEART DISSIPATION HAS BLUNTED THE FEELINGS
3997-180294-0000 THE DUKE COMES EVERY MORNING THEY WILL TELL HIM WHEN HE COMES THAT I AM ASLEEP AND PERHAPS HE WILL WAIT UNTIL I AWAKE
3997-180294-0002 WELL DO IT FOR ME FOR I SWEAR TO YOU THAT I DON'T LOVE YOU AS THE OTHERS HAVE LOVED YOU
3997-180294-0001 YES BUT IF I SHOULD ALREADY ASK FOR SOMETHING WHAT
3997-180294-0015 THIS IS THE SAME WITH THESE UNHAPPY WOMEN WITH THE LOVE SERIOUSLY
3997-180294-0004 I DON'T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
3997-180294-0011 THEY LOVED BY PROFESSION AND NOT BY INSTINCT
3997-180294-0003 THERE ARE BOLTS IN THE DOOR WRETCH
3997-180294-0005 NOW GO I CAN'T KEEP MY EYES OPEN
3997-180294-0013 THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PROOF TO GIVE
3997-180294-0016 BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INSPIRES THIS REDEEMING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH AND SOUL TO RECED IT WITHOUT REMEMBERING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVES HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVES AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRAINS AT ONEROUGHT ALL EARTHLY EMOTIONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSED TO EVERY OTHER
3997-180294-0026 AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONSTANTLY FIXED OPEN AND MARGUERITE APPEARED
3997-180294-0029 YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IRONIC E WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DELICATE AND WITTY FACE
3997-180294-0021 MY WHOLE BEING WAS EXALTED INTO JOY AT THE MEMORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXCHANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
3997-180294-0028 WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MARGUERITE RISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND KISSING ME ON THE FOREHEAD
3997-180294-0027 DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKS THE HAPPIER I SHOULD BE
3997-180294-0018 WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD GAIETY
3997-180294-0017 BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MALAISISON
3997-180294-0022 HERE ARE MY ORDERS TO NIGHT AT A VAUDEVILLE
3997-180294-0025 ONLY ONE REMAINED EMPTY A STAGE BOX
3997-180294-0019 THE WOMAN BECOMES THE MAN'S MISTRESS AND LOVES HIM
3997-180294-0031 YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK
3997-180294-0024 THE BOXES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
3997-180294-0030 WHERE AT HOME
3997-180294-0023 CALM DUR THE THIRD ENTRTRA
3997-180294-0020 HOW WHY
3997-180297-0013 WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MARVELLOUS CREATURE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONGED TO KISS WAS WILLING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONTENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MEN'S DESIRE HAD INDEED LIMITS WHEN SINCE FIVE AS PROMPTLY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
3997-180297-0005 YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISHING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLAMING ME FOR SAYING NO
3997-180294-0033 NONE THE LESS I WAS VERY UNHAPPY ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SADLY AFTER HAVING SEEN PRUDENCE THE COUNT AND MARGUERITE GET INTO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS WINNING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
3997-180297-0010 I FANCIED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPPINESS FOR SIX MONTHS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INSISTED ON KNOWING THE MEANS
3997-180297-0002 WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PRUDENCE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AMUSING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRIVE
3997-180297-0008 IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRETS FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
3997-180297-0006 BECAUSE I AM WATCHED AND THE LEAST SUSPICION MIGHT DO ME THE GREATEST HARM
3997-180297-0004 MY DEAR PRUDENCE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
3997-180297-0009 HONESTLY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
3997-180297-0003 DURING THIS REMARK MARGUERITE LOOKED AT ME ATTENTIVELY
3997-180297-0011 WELL GOOD HEAVENS THE MEANS WERE EASY ENOUGH TO GUESS
3997-180297-0012 I LISTENED AND I GAZED AT MARGUERITE WITH ADMIRATION
3997-180297-0001 YOU IN THE WAY MARGUERITE BUT HOW
3997-180297-0000 I HAVE NOT COME TO HINDER YOU FROM LEAVING PARIS
3997-180297-0007 IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
3997-180294-0032 BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE SEEING HIM
3997-180297-0019 IT MEAN LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVERS EXTRA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESSES OR A BRACELET OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRIVE AND ARE CARRIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE FUTURE
3997-180297-0023 MARGUERITE TIRED OUT WITH HIS LONG CONFESSION THREW HERSELF BACK ON THE SOFA AND TO STIFLE A SLIGHT COUGH PUT UP HER HANDKERCHIEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
3997-180297-0024 MARGUERITE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLAVE YOUR DOG BUT THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WROTE TO YOU AND DID NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MORROW IT WOULD KILL ME
3997-180297-0014 TRULY SHE CONTINUED WE POORER CREATURES OF CHANCE HAVE FANTASTIC DESIRE AND INCONCEIVABLE LOVES
3997-180297-0020 SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DUKE BUT THE DUKE IS OLD AND THE OLD AGE NEITHER PROTECTS NOR CONSOLES
3997-180297-0025 MARGUERITE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BOSOM AND TENDING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INFINITE SWEETNESS SAID
3997-180297-0015 WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE HEARTS UNDER THE PENALTY OF BEING HOOTED DOWN AND OF RUINING OUR CREDIT
3997-180297-0022 WHAT I LOVED IN YOU WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
3997-180297-0028 LOOK HERE PRUDENCE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANTS SAID MARGUERITE
3997-180297-0027 I TOY A LETTER INTO FRAGMENTS AND KISSED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME
3997-180297-0021 I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIVES WHICH HE OFFERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
3997-180297-0017 WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF ESTEEMED LAST IN THEIR ESTEEM
3997-180297-0018 NEVER DID HE GIVE YE ADVICE WHICH NOT LOOKRATIVE
3997-180297-0026 HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
3997-180297-0016 WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OURSELVES
3997-180297-0029 HE WANTS YOU TO FORGIVE HIM
3997-182399-0006 WAY BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN GRANDNPA BUZZER HAD HIS LITTLE FALLING OUT WITH OLD KING EAGLE AND DONE FLIES SO HIGH HE SCORCHED THE FEATHERS OFF IN HIS HEAD HE HAD A COUSIN DID GRANDPA BUZZARD AND THIS COUSIN WAS JUST NATURALLY LAZY AND NO COUCH
3997-182399-0008 WAS'T ANYTHING GOING ON THAT THIS TRIFLING MEMBER OF THE PUZZARD FAMILY DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT A MEDDLE INN HE COULD ASK MORE QUESTIONS THAN PETER RABBIT CAN AND ANYBODY THAT CAN DO THAT HAS GOT TO ASK A LOT
3997-182399-0005 NOW ALL MISTER BUZZARD IS NATURALLY GOOD NATURED AND ACCOMMODATING AND WHEN PETER BEGGED SO HARD HE JUST COULDN'T FIND IT IN HIS HEART TO REFUSE
3997-182399-0007 LIKE MOST NOCO PEOPLE HE USED TO MAKE A REGULAR NOTANCE OF HISSELF POKING HIS NOSE INTO EVERY EVERYBODY'S BUSINESS AND NEVER TENDING TO HIS OWN
3997-182399-0010 SO WILLIAMS SET ON THE CHIMNEY TOPS WHENEVER OLD JACK FOST GETS TO STRAYING DOWN WHERE HE HAVE NO BUSINESS
3997-182399-0013 WHY HE JUST STRETCH HIS FULL HEAD AS FAR DOWN THE CHIMNEY AS HE CAN AND LISTEN AND LISTEN
3997-182399-0011 ONE DAY THIS NO COUNT'S TRIFLING COUSIN OF GRANDNPA BUZZARD GET COLD IN HIS FEET
3997-182399-0002 HE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT THAT BLACK HEADED COUSIN OF OLD MISTER BUZZARD VERY CURIOUS INDEED

4198-12281-0015 IN THE MEANTIME FRIAR JOHN WITH HIS FORMIDABLE BATON OF THE CROSS GOT TO THE BREACH WHICH THE ENEMIES HAD MADE AND THERE STOOD TO SNATCH UP THOSE THAT ENDEAVORED TO ESCAPE
4198-61336-0000 IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF AHER BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
4198-61336-0005 AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING C CHAORUS WHO LEAPED FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HARTLY PRESUMED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGION OF CAVALRY

4198-61336-0004 A FIERCE BATTLE ENSU AND ONE OF HIS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
4198-61336-0006 DESPITE THE BLOW DEALED AGAINST HUU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
4198-61336-0001 AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
4198-61336-0010 OR PAD WAS CAPTURED AND MET TO IU DEPOSED AND PROBABLY PUT TO DEATH
4198-61336-0011 ONCE AGAIN THE HEBREWS CAME INTO CONTACT WITH THE SYRIA

4198-61336-0016 NO RESISTANCE WAS POSSIBLE ON THE PART OF MANY HE THE USURPER WHO WAS PROBABLY READY TO WELCOME THE ASSYRIAN CONQUEROR SO THAT BY ARRANGING AN ALLIANCE HE MIGHT SECURE HIS OWN POSITION
4198-61336-0018 HE OVERTHREW BUILDINGS DESTROYED ORCHARDS AND TRANSPORTED TO NINEVEH THOSE OF THE INHABITANTS HE HAD NOT PUT TO THE SWORD WITH ALL THE LIVE STOCK HE COULD LAY HANDS ONN
4198-61336-0019 THUS WAS HERU CRIPPLED AND HUMILIATED IT NEVER REGAINED ITS FORMER PRESTIGS AMONG THE NORTHERN STATES
4198-61336-0021 MANYHEM KING OF ISRAEL HAD DIED AND WAS SUCCEEDED BY HIS SON PECAIOAH
4198-61336-0017 TAKE LASTLIER NEXT OPERATED AGAINST THE MEDIUM AND OTHER HILL TRIBES IN THE NORTHEAST
4198-61336-0022 JUAH HAD TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE DISTURBED CONDITIONS IN ISRAEL TO ASSERT ITS INDEPENDENCE
4198-61336-0013 JEOASH THE GRANDSON OF JEHU HAD ACHIEVED SUCCESSES IN CONFLICT WITH DAMASCUS
4198-61336-0014 SIX MONTHS AFTERWARD HE WAS ASSASSINATED BY SCHLANM
4198-61336-0028 THE FAIRESTINE AND THE ARABIANS OF THE DESERT WERE ALSO SUBDUED
4198-61336-0020 IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TILA BE LEISUREER RETURN TO SYRIA
4198-61336-0015 THIS USURPER HELD SWAY AT SUMERIA ONLY A MONTH
4198-61336-0023 HE CONDEMNED ISRAEL FOR ITSS IOLATRIES AND CRIED
4198-61336-0027 HE SWEPT THROUGH ISRAEL LIKE A HURRICANE
4198-61336-0025 THE REMNANT OF THE PHILISTINE SHALL PARISH
4198-61336-0026 ISRAEL WAS ALSO DEALT WITH
4294-14317-0009 I SAID MY LORD I THANK YOU AND BEG YOU TO CONDESCEND SO FAR AS TO LISTEN TO FOUR WORDS IT IS TRUE THAT HE LENT ME A PAIR OF OLD SCALES TWO EMVILS AND THREE LITTLE HAMMERS WHICH ARTICLES I BEGGED HIS WORKMEN GEORGIO DECK CORONA FIFTEEN DAYS AGO TO FETCH BACK
4294-14317-0004 BUT BEWARE OF LETTING BEND NELLO QUIT YOU RATHER BESTOW UPON HIM ALWAYS MORE THAN HE DEMANDS FOR HE GOES INTO FOREIGN PARTS HIS IGNORANCE IS SO PRESUMPTUOUS THAT HE IS JUST THE MAN TO DISGRACE OUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS SCHOOL
4294-14317-0001 WHEN I SAW THAT THIS BUST CAME OUT SHARP ANK CLEAN I SAID AT ONCE TO CONSTRUCT A LITTLE FURNACE IN THE WORKSHOP ERECTED FOR ME BY THE DUKE AFTER MY OWN PLANS AND DESIGN IN THE HOUSE WHICH THE DUKE HAD GIVEN ME
4294-14317-0012 WHEN HE HAD HEARD THIS SPEECH THE DUKE ROSE UP IN ANGER AND SENT FOR BERNARDON WHO WAS FORCED TO TAKE FLIGHT AS FAR AS VENICE HE ANTONI LANDY WITH HIM
4198-61336-0030 KINDER TOOK REFUGE IN HIS CAPITAL SHAPIA WHICH HELD OUT SUCCESSFULLY ALTHOUGH THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY WAS RAVAGED AND DESPOILED
4294-14317-0007 I HAD BETTER LOOK TO MY CONDUCT FOR IT HAD COME TO HIS EARS THAT I RELIED UPON HIS FAVOUR TO TAKE IN FIRST ONE MAN AND THEN ANOTHER
4294-14317-0002 IT WAS AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TASK AND I WAS ANXIOUS TO OBSERVE ALL THE NICETIES OF ART WHICH I HAD LEARNED SO AS NOT TO LAPSE INTO SOME ERROR
4294-14317-0006 THEN I THANKED HIM AND SAID I HAD NO GREATER DESIRE THAN TO SHOW THOSE ENVIOUS FOLK THAT I HAD IT IN ME TO EXECUTE THE PROMISED WORK
4294-14317-0000 AS I THOUGHT THAT THIS WAS DUE TO SOME FAULT IN THE EARTH I WANTED TO MAKE THESE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I UNDERTOOK MY PERSEUS
4294-14317-0003 I IN MY TURN FEEL THE SAME DESIRE AND HOPE TO PLAY MY PART LIKE THEM THEREFORE MY LORD GIVE ME THE LEAVE TO GO
4294-14317-0005 I ASKED NO FURTHER REWARD FOR MY LABOURS UP TO THIS TIME THAN THE GRACIOUS FAVOUR OF YOUR MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-14317-0008 I BEGGED HIS MOST LUTROUS EXCELLENCY TO NAME A SINGLE PERSON I HAD EVER TAKEN IN
4294-14317-0011 I HOPE TO PROVE ON WHAT ACCOUNT THAT SCOUNDREL TRIES TO BRING ME INTO DISGRACE
4294-14317-0013 YOU HAD BETTER PUT THIS TO THE PROOF AND I WILL GO AT ONCE TO THE BARIANNO
4198-61336-0029 HE INVADED BABYLONIA
4294-14317-0010 GEORGIO CAME FOR THEM HIS HEALTH
4294-14317-0014 I AM WILLING TO ENTER INTO COMPETITION WITH THE ANCIENTS AND FEEL ABLE TO SURPASS THEM FOR SINCE THOSE EARLY DAYS IN WHICH I MADE THE MEDALS OF POPE CLEMENT I HAVE LEARNED SO MUCH THAT I CAN NOW PRODUCE FAR BETTER PIECES OF THE KIND I THINK I CAN ALSO OUTDO THE COINS I STRUCK FOR DUKE GALIANDRO WHICH ARE STILL HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM IN LIKE MANNER I COULD MAKE FOR YOU LARGE PIECES OF GOLD AND SILVER PLATE AS I DID SO OFTEN FOR THAT NOBLE MONARCH KING FRANCIS OF FRANCE THANKS TO THE GREAT CONVENIENCES HE ALLOWED ME WITHOUT EVER LOSING TIME FOR THE EXECUTION OF COLOSSAL STATUES OR OTHER WORKS OF THE SCULPTOR'S CRAFT
4294-32859-0001 IT WAS HIS FANCY I SUPPOSE TO REVIVE CERTAIN SENTIMENTAL RELATIONS WHICH HAD IT MAY BE ONCE EXISTED BETWEEN HIM AND MISS LAKE AND HE WAS A PERSON OF THAT COMBATIVE TEMPERAMENT THAT MAGNIFIES AN OBJECT IN PROPORTION AS ITS PURSUIT IS THWARTED
4294-32859-0004 HE INSISTED AT IT BUT TOOK NO PART AND IN FACT WAS LISTENING TO THAT OTHER CONVERSATION WHICH SOUNDED WITH ITS PLEASANT GABBLE AND LAUGHTER LIKE A LITTLE MUSICAL TINKLE OF BELLS IN THE DISTANCE
4294-14317-0017 NOW I HOPE TO SHOW THEM THAT I AM AN OLD SCULPTOR IF GOD SHALL GRANT ME THE BOON OF FINISHING MY PERSEUS FOR THAT NOBLE PIAZZA OF HIS MOST ILLUSTRIOUS EXCELLENCY
4294-35475-0001 ROWING HIMSELF ON HIS KNEES BEFORE THE KING HE CRIED O ROYAL SIRE BESTOW UPON ME ALSO A SWORD AND HIS STEED THAT I MAY UP AND AWAY TO FOLLOW MY BRETHREN
4294-35475-0003 IN SOOTH THOU SHALT HAVE ONE BUT IT SHALL BE ONE BEFITTING THY MAIDEN SIZE AND COURAGE IF SO SMALL A WEAPON CAN BE FOUND IN ALL MY KINGDOM
4294-32859-0005 BUT HONEST MARK FORGOT THAT YOUNG LADIES DO NOT ALWAYS COME OUT QUITE ALONE AND JUMP UNASSISTED INTO THEIR VEHICLES
4294-35475-0004 FORTHWITH THE GRINNING GESTURE BEGAN SHRIEKING WITH LAUGHTER SO THAT THE BELLS UPON HIS MOTLEY CAP WERE ALL SET A JANGLING
4294-14317-0015 AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS WERE WASTED AND PIANO WOULD NEITHER WORK NOR PUT MEN TO WORK UPON THE PIECE I MADE HIM GIVE IT BACK
4294-35475-0000 BUT THE MIDDLE SUN WAS LITTLE IN LAWN HE WAS NEITHER DARK NOR FAIR HE WAS NEITHER HANDSOME NOR STRONG
4294-14317-0016 AMONG ARTISTS CERTAIN ENRAGED SCULPTORS LAUGHED AT ME AND CALLED ME THE NEW SCULPT
4294-32859-0000 WYLDER WAS RATHER SURLY AFTER THE LADIES HAD FLOATED AWAY FROM THE SCENE AND HE DRANK HIS LIQUOR DOGGEDLY
4294-35475-0002 BUT THE KING LAUGHT HIM TO SCORN THOU A SWORD HE QUOTH
4294-14317-0018 HAVING THIS EXCELLENT RESOLVE IN HEART I REACHED MY HOME
4294-32859-0002 THE STORY OF FRIEDALLIN AND WRETCHES PRETTY OUTLINES
4294-32859-0003 SIT DOWN BESIDE ME AND I'LL TELL YOU THE STORY
4294-35475-0019 WHILE HE STOOD LOOKING AROUND HIM IN BEWILDERMENT A FIREFLY ALIGHTED DOWN HIS ARM FLASHING ITS LITTLE LANTERN AND THE PRINCE'S FACE IT CRIED THIS WAY MY FRIEND THE FLY SENT ME TO GUY DO TO A PLACE OF SAFETY
4294-35475-0011 HE COULD SEE THE OGRE STANDING POWERLESS TO HURT HIM ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHASM AND GNASHING HIS TEETH EACH ONE OF WHICH WAS AS BIG AS A MILLSTONE
4294-35475-0008 IT HAD SUDDENLY DISAPPEARED AND IN ITS PLACE STOOD A BEAUTIFUL FAIRY WITH FILY WINGS WHICH SHONE LIKE RAINBOWS IN THE MOONLIGHT
4294-35475-0005 I DID BUT LAUGH TO THINK THE SWORD OF ETHLERED HAD BEEN SO QUICKLY FOUND RESPONDED THE JESTER AND HE POINTED TO THE SCISSORS HANGING FROM THE TAILOR'S GIRDLE
4294-35475-0017 AS HE UTTERED THE WORDS THE SCISSORS LEAPED OUT OF HIS HAND AND BEGAN TO CUT THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS AS EASILY AS THROUGH ITS CHEESE
4294-35475-0009 AT THIS MOMENT THERE WAS A DISTANT RUMBLING AS A THUNDER TIS THE OGRE CRIED THE FAIRY WE MUST HASTEN
4294-35475-0006 ONE NIGHT AS HE LAY IN A DEEP FOREST TOO UNHAPPY TO SLEEP HE HEARD A NOISE NEAR AT HAND IN THE BUSHES
4294-35475-0016 THE PRINCE SPENT ALL THE FOLLOWING TIME UNTIL MIDNIGHT TRYING TO THINK OF A SUITABLE VERSE TO SAY TO THE SCISSORS
4294-35475-0007 THOU SHALT HAVE THY LIBERTY HE CRIED EVEN THOUGH THOU SHOULDST RUN ME IN PIECES THE MOMENT THOU ART FREE
4294-35475-0014 HE LIFTED THE SCISSORS AND WITH ONE STROKESTRODE THE WE AND GAVE THE FLY TO READ HIM
4294-35475-0012 THE SIGHT WAS SO TERRIBLE THAT HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND FLED AWAY AS FAST AS HIS FEET COULD CARRY HIM
4294-35475-0013 THOU SHALT NOT BE LEFT A PRISONER IN THIS DISMAL SPOT WHILE I HAVE THE POWER TO HELP THEE
4294-35475-0015 A FAINT GLIMMER OF LIGHT ON THE OPPOSITE WALL SHOWS ME THE KEYHO
4294-35475-0010 SCISSORS GROW A GIANT'S HEIGHT AND SAVE US WHOM THE OGRES MIGHT
4294-35475-0018 IN A VERY SHORT TIME THE PRINCE HAD CRAWLED THROUGH THE OPENING
4294-35475-0020 WHAT IS TO BECOME OF ME CRIED THE POOR PEASANT

4294-9934-0000 HE FELT WHAT THE EARTH MAY POSSIBLY FEEL AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT IS TORN OPEN WITH THE IRON IN ORDER THAT GRAIN MAY BE DEPOSITED WITHIN IT IT FEELS ONLY THE WOUND THE QUIVER OF THE GERM THE JOY OF THE FRUIT ONLY ARRIVED LATER
4294-35475-0023 TO HIM WHO COULD BRING HER BACK TO HER FATHER'S CASTLE SHOULD BE GIVEN THE THRONE AND KINGDOM AS WELL AS THE PRINCESS HERSELF SO FROM FAR AND NEAR INDEED FROM ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY UNDER THE SUN CAME KNIGHTS AND PRINCES TO FIGHT THE OGRE
4294-9934-0003 TO STAND BETWEEN TWO RELIGIONS FROM ONE OF WHICH YOU HAVE NOT AS YET EMERGED AND ANOTHER INTO WHICH YOU HAVE NOT YET ENTERED IS INTOLERABLE AND TWILIGHT IS PLEASING ONLY TO BAT LIKE SOULS
4294-9934-0006 WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REMAIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HALT THERE HE WAS IRRESISTIBLY CONSTRAINED TO CONTINUE TO ADVANCE TO EXAMINE TO THINK TO MARCH FURTHER
4294-9934-0002 HE AFFIRMED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT HE DECLARED TO HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT DOUBT AND HE BEGAN TO DOUBT IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
4294-35475-0021 MY GRAIN MUST FALL ANDROT IN THE FIELD FROM OVER RIPEENESS BECAUSE I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH TO RISE AND HARVEST IT THEN INDEED MUST WE ALL STARVE
4294-9934-0007 HE FEARED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEPS WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEARER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD ESTRANGE HIM FROM THAT FATHER
4294-9934-0009 IN THE TROUBLED STATE OF HIS CONSCIENCE HE NO LONGER THOUGHT OF CERTAIN SERIOUS SIDES OF EXISTENCE
4294-35475-0024 AMONG THOSE WHO DREW BACK WERE ETHELRIED'S BROTHERS THE THREE THAT WERE DARK AND THE THREE THAT WERE FAIR

4350-10919-0001 BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
4350-10919-0011 HE ASKED AH IT IS
4350-10919-0020 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
4350-10919-0016 BUT IN FAVOUR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING A PREMICENCE
4350-10919-0018 AH WELL IN THAT HASTE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
4350-10919-0021 OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
4350-10919-0023 WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
4350-10919-0022 AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
4350-10919-0013 AND HOW AAH TO HERBROAD ASKED THE FELLOW DOCTOR
4350-10919-0015 THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
4350-10919-0024 SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
4350-10919-0014 WHAT IS WANTED IS THE MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION ENOUGH FOR LOWERING IT
4350-10919-0025 EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
4350-10919-0026 THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
4350-10919-0019 OH TIMES UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
4350-10919-0027 THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENCE
4350-10919-0017 AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
4350-10919-0012 OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
4350-9170-0009 POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN AND POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
4350-10919-0029 AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
4350-9170-0002 IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
4350-9170-0003 THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
4350-9170-0006 THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE THE PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON AND SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
4350-10919-0031 FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
4350-9170-0000 EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
4350-10919-0030 BUT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
4350-10919-0028 NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
4350-10919-0033 THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
4350-9170-0007 THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTED THE ARMY
4350-9170-0004 THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
4350-10919-0032 IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
4350-9170-0008 THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
4350-9170-0005 THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
4350-9170-0001 THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
4350-9170-0025 THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIER ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTRE ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
4350-9170-0013 EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARDS OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS LESS IN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
4350-9170-0019 GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
4350-9170-0012 BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
4350-9170-0024 THE UPPER CLASSS KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED DRINK OF THE ARMY
4350-9170-0021 THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
4350-9170-0023 FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXISTS IN SPITE OF A SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TRUCE NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
4350-9170-0014 BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIPE BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL SEEMED STILL LESS AND A LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
4350-9170-0016 AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
4350-9170-0020 AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LEMON BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN NECKS
4350-9170-0018 INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
4350-9170-0015 IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE IN CONQUEST
4350-9170-0011 ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
4350-9170-0017 BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
4350-9170-0010 INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
4350-9170-0022 SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
4350-9170-0036 IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORISTS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE THE GROUPS OF PERSONS
4350-9170-0033 THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS HAS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
4350-9170-0037 BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARORY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MET TO AVOID
4350-9170-0028 BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS I EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ARE ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVE SUBJECTS
4350-9170-0026 THE MEANING OF CAPPRIVVI SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVE TOILING MASSES
4350-9170-0031 EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBOURING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
4350-9170-0032 THE DESPOTISM OF THE GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
4350-9170-0041 BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
4350-9170-0038 BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSED THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0034 AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTISED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN IMPRESSORS
4350-9170-0039 THE TAXES RAISE FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
4350-9170-0040 THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
4350-9170-0029 AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
4350-9170-0030 THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESCEU POINTED OUT A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
4350-9170-0035 THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS AND UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
4350-9170-0027 AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THANKS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
4350-9170-0057 EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDEN LAID ON HIM BY THE STATES NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGES THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
4350-9170-0052 THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORM SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
4350-9170-0043 THERE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THAT ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
4350-9170-0048 SO THAT THIS JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL EXPOSE PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
4350-9170-0045 I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF A STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
4350-9170-0056 THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
4350-9170-0055 AND IF DEFENCE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
4350-9170-0047 WE NOW KNOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMA AND MORAL INFLUENCE
4350-9170-0049 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION SO ON
4350-9170-0046 EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
4350-9170-0054 THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBOURING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
4350-9170-0050 WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANYTHING
4350-9170-0042 GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
4350-9170-0051 THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
4350-9170-0053 WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
4350-9170-0044 AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
4852-28311-0009 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKIE WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGED INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRISTID INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
4852-28311-0005 MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED IN MOASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT IN E STREET
4350-9170-0060 FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
4350-9170-0059 SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINE OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASS AND OPPRESS HER
4852-28311-0010 MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT M CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTLY ENCOURAGED
4852-28311-0007 CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
4852-28311-0001 CHRIS LOOKED FROM ANCKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JACK AND SPARK PLUG
4350-9170-0058 TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
4852-28311-0002 NO ONE NEEDS A JOB BAN THAT'S JAE HARRIS
4852-28311-0011 A BITCHER AND GO AFTER ALL IT HAS TURNED TO IN HIM
4852-28311-0004 ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF
4852-28311-0008 THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT IN PURSUIT
4852-28311-0006 WELL HE ADMITTED I DID
4852-28311-0003 O K HE SAID
4852-28311-0012 MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE QUARTER
4852-28311-0000 SAY YOU KNOW SU
4852-28311-0016 THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK GOT A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON A WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE MESCONSIN AVENUEE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BALCH SHRUGS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
4852-28311-0022 ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GRAIN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY AND BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
4852-28312-0000 OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND POURED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOARD HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
4852-28311-0015 AN EMPTY LOT CUT IN INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE AIR SHAPED BRICK BUILDINGITER MISTER WICKER'S BOTH HOUSE IN PLACE OF BUSINESS
4852-28311-0023 BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
4852-28311-0014 CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING A BLAKE LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
4852-28312-0001 SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL THEY LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
4852-28311-0017 A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES IN GREY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
4852-28311-0019 ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING AND HIM IMP PINCHED AND TIGHTENED IT SELF
4852-28311-0021 THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
4852-28311-0025 HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
4852-28311-0024 HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
4852-28311-0018 THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH THE JOB
4852-28311-0026 A SUDDEN CARHOR WALK FROM THIS DREAM
4852-28311-0020 AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
4852-28311-0013 AH SHOCKS
4852-28312-0017 BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY DO HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP UP AROUND THE COIER OF WALL AT HER STREET NOT THE HILL TOWARD DIIC SIGNALS
4852-28312-0006 LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZS ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WITH THE OLD MAN'S EYES
4852-28312-0014 WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCEUITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
4852-28312-0005 THE DOUBLE FANS A MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEK BONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
4852-28312-0002 WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBRE
4852-28312-0004 MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
4852-28312-0016 WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKIE GIGS GETTING THE JOB SIR
4852-28312-0015 HE GUESSED THERE IT MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
4852-28312-0007 CHRISSP LIKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
4852-28312-0003 HEAVY HAND YOUW AND BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
4852-28312-0013 I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN
4852-28312-0008 CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
4852-28312-0010 I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0012 JIGGIE E'S NAME IS AND HE REELLY NEEDS THE JOB
4852-28312-0011 HE'S A SCHOOLATE OF MIND
4852-28312-0009 YES SIR HE SAID
4852-28312-0020 THE WIDE BOW WIND IT WAS THERE BEFORE HIM AND THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
4852-28312-0026 WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUG STORE HAD STOOD BUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN IN
4852-28312-0027 A COURTY YARD WAS FIRSTELY LIT BY FLARING TORTURE TWO SHOWING THE SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON THE POST
4852-28312-0024 FLABRICGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRISST WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
4852-28312-0022 IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0001 HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE HE GOT SIMON GOSTLER HIS HOARD OF MONEY IN HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
4852-28312-0029 THE COACHMAN HAD STOPPED PILED HIGH WITH LEGGED STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAGED COURTYARD
4852-28312-0031 MY WINDOW HAS A PATH FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
4852-28312-0028 THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF IT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MONEY ROAD
4852-28312-0025 NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLET STREETS
4852-28312-0021 ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE FREE WAY
4852-28312-0030 THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
4852-28312-0019 THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
4852-28319-0000 THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
4852-28312-0018 THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY STILL
4852-28312-0023 THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL
4852-28319-0003 ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE HAD RETURNED AFTER REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
4852-28319-0011 HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING A PRIDE AND COMMENCEDED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED BUT OS BY
4852-28319-0016 HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINED THE CARVED WOODEN AND FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
4852-28319-0005 HOW YOU'VE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW A TIME FOR YOU TO TRY THIS HAS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
4852-28319-0013 THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLELE A CURVE DUCK POINTING TOES
4852-28319-0010 HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
4852-28319-0008 THAT IS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WICKGGER SAID START AT ONCE
4852-28319-0002 CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF AND ALL THE PRILIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
4852-28319-0007 MISTER WICKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
4852-28319-0015 IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
4852-28319-0012 SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE THE RETURN
4852-28319-0006 SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CATCH CHANGE BACK
4852-28319-0009 A SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
4852-28319-0017 BUT HOW DID ONE A CHANGE INANIMATE TO AN OF
4852-28319-0014 THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS
4852-28319-0004 WHAT SHOULD ALL I DO FIRST
4852-28319-0019 HE HEARD THAT MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REELLY EMPTY WITH SIROON'S PROPER SHAPE AND OPEN THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
4852-28319-0026 UNDER HIS EYES WEDD FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
4852-28319-0023 MISTER WICKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKED AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE FORTUNE FUMED AND GLOWED
4852-28319-0027 THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CAR FLOWERS MOVED THE BOUQUET FALL
4852-28319-0024 WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOORS SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHT FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE AT THE NEGRO BOY
4852-28330-0003 IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD BEEN OF IN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO WHAT'LL GIVE MY EYES OPEN
4852-28330-0002 NEXT NEDIL WAS RELIEVED TO THE HELM BY AL JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
4852-28330-0001 GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
4852-28319-0021 THUS CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLS IN THE SKY
4852-28319-0022 CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME
4852-28319-0020 THE AFTERNOON RAINING BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM
4852-28319-0018 CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
4852-28330-0005 WE'VE BOUGHT HER AND FRESH STALLS TO TICKLE THERE
4852-28319-0025 IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
4852-28330-0000 THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
4852-28330-0004 THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING DED
4852-28330-0009 HIS FACE ROSE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT DO OUTDO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
4852-28330-0018 HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
4852-28330-0006 CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
4852-28330-0013 PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM
4852-28330-0021 I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDIIPMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS A CAPTAIN OF SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT
4852-28330-0019 THE CAMOUFLCHE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME HE HAD UNDERSTOOD
4852-28330-0007 C CERTAINTLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY HE AND PENETRATING
4852-28330-0016 YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR
4852-28330-0011 THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO
4852-28330-0008 MISTER FINNA WOULD BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OWN HEARD IN HERE
4852-28330-0010 THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
4852-28330-0015 THIS SHIP ITS CARGO IN ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
4852-28330-0012 THE SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN MY POOR MOTHER OR FAMILY
4852-28330-0020 WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS OUGHT TO ASK
4852-28330-0017 CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACED CREASED IN ITS WINNING SMILE
4852-28330-0014 WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
533-1066-0002 I'M SURE I KISSED LADY AND I'VE HAD SEVERAL MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SOONT REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAON TOO WITH THE EXCITEMENT
533-1066-0001 I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSAND OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
533-1066-0004 OUT OF DEFERE LIY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND A CONCOED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
533-1066-0005 MISS EANES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UPSTAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NURSES TO NIGHT
533-1066-0007 I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
533-1066-0011 LIDDY WAS SLEEPING SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UPSTAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
533-1066-0010 PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME ALLED OUR CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
4852-28330-0024 HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR
4852-28330-0023 NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER AND CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
533-1066-0003 FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVE WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN LODGE
533-1066-0008 THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN'T THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT
533-1066-0009 SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID
533-1066-0006 I HAVE NONE I SAID HAPPILY
4852-28330-0022 I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
4852-28330-0025 THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME OF THE WHILE
533-1066-0000 WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN
533-1066-0013 THERE WERE A FEW PREPARATIONS TO BE MADE LOCKS TO BE GONE OVER WINTERS TO INSTRUCTIVE AS TO RENEWED VISGILANCE AND THEN AFTER EXTINGUISHING THE WHOLE LIGHT WE CREPT IN THE DARKNESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
533-1066-0015 WAS ONLY SOMEBODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EMPHATIC BIT PROFANITY FROM DOCTORU WHEN HE RAN INTO A WIRE FENCE
533-131556-0002 TOWARD TEARSES ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GUILTY CONFESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HATE HIM I HATE HIM

533-1066-0017 THE DOCTOR WAS PUFFING SOMEWHAT WHERE WE FINALLY CAME TO A HALT
533-1066-0022 THERE'S ONE THING SURE I'LL NOT BE SUSPECTED OFLACITY
533-1066-0012 THEY WERE CHUCKING CO FEELINGTLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED
533-1066-0020 IT WAS ALEX ARMED THE TWO LONG HANDLED SPADES
533-1066-0021 THE DOCTOR KEPT THE KIN LOOK OUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED

533-1066-0014 I ASK NO QUESTIONS
533-131556-0003 I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CREDIT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIED SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUTY TO SUSPECT HIM UNDER THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED

533-131556-0014 I WATCHED HER A FEW MOMENTS TO THE FEELING OF MALEVOLENT GRATTIFICATION THEN MOVING TOWARDS THE DOOR I CALMLY ASKED IF SHE HAD ANYTHING MORE TO SAY
533-131556-0013 SHE COLOURED AGAIN EXCESSIVELY AND REMAINED SILENT RESTING HER FINGER AGAINST HER CHEEK AND GAZING INTO FIRE

5442-32873-0003 OH FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL IS IT A DREAM
533-131564-0027 AFTER THAT THEY WILL REPAIR TO THEIR COUNTRY HOME
5442-32873-0002 A SLAVE ONLY THINK A SLAVE
5442-32873-0004 OH FRIGHTFUL FRIGHTFUL
5442-32873-0014 LOOK TOOK CARE OF MISTER LARKIN'S DOGSGG AND GROOMED MISTER W WILDER'S HORSE AND CLEANED UP HIS DOOR CART FOR MARK BEING FLOS ABOUT MONEY AND FINDING THAT THE THING WAS TO BE DONE MORE CHEAPLY THAT WAY PUT UP HIS HORSE AND DOOR CART IN THE POST OFFICE PREMISES AND SO EVADED THE LIVERY CHARGES OF THE BRANDON ARMS
5442-41168-0002 HE WAS SHOUTING FOR THE VERY COARSE SURGY IVANOVITCH HAD PROPOSED BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE HATED HIM AND ALL HIS PARTY AND THIS FEELING OF HATRED SPREAD THROUGH THE WHOLE PARTY AND DRAGGED IN OPPOSITION TO IT THE SAME VINDICTIVENESS THOUGH IN A MORE SEEMLY FORM ON THE OTHER SIDE
5442-32873-0013 HE SLACKENED A SPACE AND TAPPED SHARPLY AT THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THE MODESTEST POST OFFICE AT WHICH THE YOUNG LADIES IN THE PONY CARRIAGE HAD PULLED UP THE DAY BEFORE AND WITHIN WHICH LEKE WAGGETT WAS WONT TO SLEEP IN A SORT OF WOODEN BOX THAT FOLDED UP AND APPEARED TO BE A CHEST OF DRAWERS ALL DAY
5442-32873-0018 LUKE STUCK ON HIS GREASY WIDE AWAKEG AND IN A FEW MINUTES MORE THE DARK CART WAS STRANLED OUT INTO THE  LANENE AND THE HORSE HARNESSED WENT BETWEEN THE SHAFTS WITH THAT WONDERFUL CHEERFULNESS WITH WHICH THEY BEAR TO BE CALLED UP AND THE STARTLING CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNSEASONABLE HOURS
5442-32873-0016 HERE WERE THE FLOW OF SOUL AND OF STOUT LONG PIPES LONG YARNS AND TOLERABLY LONG CREDITS AND THE HUMBLE GAVE GRACES OF THE TOWN RESORTED THITHER FOR THE PLEASURES OF A CLUBUG LIFE AND OFTEN REVELED DEEP INTO THE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING
5442-32873-0015 BUT LUKE WAS NOT THERE AND CAPTAIN LAKE RECOLLECTING HIS HABITS AND HIS HAUNT HURRIED ON TO THE SILVER LION WHICH HAS ITS CABLE TOWARDS THE COMMON ONLY ABOUT A HUNDRED STEPS AWAY FOR DISTANCES ARE NOT GREAT IN JOILLING
5442-41168-0003 SHOUTS WERE RAISED AND FOR A MOMENT ALL WAS CONFUSION SO THAT THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE HAD TO CALL FOR OO A BALLOT
5442-41168-0005 THE CONFIDENCE OF THE MONARCH NEAR CHECKING THE ACCOUNTS OF THE MARTIANIO HE'S NOT A CASHIER BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT
5442-41168-0001 HE WENT UP TO THE TABLE AND STRIKING IT WITH HIS FINGERING HE SHOUTED LOUDLY A BALLOT
5442-32873-0019 IF I THOUGHT YOU'D FAIL ME NOW TOMAR I SHOULD NEVER COME BACK GOOD NIGHT TOMAR
5442-41168-0000 THE ACT SAID THAT IN CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION THERE MUST BE A BALLOT
5442-32873-0012 I'LL STAY HERE THAT IS IN THE DRAWING ROOM SHE ANSWERED AND THE FACE WAS WITHDRAWN
5442-41168-0007 THEY EXPRESSED THE MOST IMPLACABLE HATRED
5442-41168-0006 VOTES PLEASE PEACEN
5442-32873-0017 LOSE NO TIME WHEN I'LL GIVE YOU HALF A CRUMB
5442-41168-0004 WE SHED OUR BLOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY
5442-41168-0009 HE FORGOT AS SIR GIOVITCH EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTERWARDS THISSYLLOGISM THAT IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PUBLIC GOOD TO GET RID OF THE MARSHAL OF THE PROVINCE THAT TO GET IT TO THE MARSHAL IT WAS NECESSARY TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF WOODS THAT TO GET A MAJORITY OF WORDS IT WAS NECESSARY TO SECURE FYODOROV'S RIGHT TO VOTE THAT TO SECURED THE RECOGNITION OF FLORA'S RIGHT TO VOTE THEY MUST DECIDE ON THE INTERPRETATION TO BE PUT ON THE ACT
5442-41168-0021 LA NEKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE EFFECT THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARSS OF SERVICE
5442-41168-0022 THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY FOR HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTY BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
5442-41168-0016 HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE THRUST IT THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
5442-41168-0008 LEVIN DID NOT IN THE LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS A MATTER AND HE MARVELLED AT THE PASSION WITH WHICH IT WAS DISPUTED WHETHER OR NOT THE DESERT ABOVE FLEDROFF SHOULD BE PUT TO THE VOTE
5442-41168-0012 HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WHISKED WAITER WHO SHOWED HIS SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JEED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKIN'S PROPERLY
5442-41168-0010 BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
5442-41168-0013 LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM YOU TO PUT IT
5442-41168-0011 TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT BAR
5442-41168-0015 THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN POSITION HE SAID SEVERELY
5442-41168-0019 THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH OF BUTTON AND TWO KNOTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
5442-41168-0017 A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY EIGHT AGAINST
5442-41168-0023 IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE
5442-41168-0018 SANG ALL THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
5442-41168-0020 BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED
5442-41168-0014 SOY IVANIT FROWNED
5442-41169-0000 LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT A SURGY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST VICKERS VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRIES UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
5442-41168-0027 ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLORARO TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMEN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
5442-41169-0007 OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED MIND BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF  SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
5442-41168-0026 TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS WAS STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
5442-41169-0001 HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND HIM
5442-41169-0004 THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
5442-41169-0003 I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
5442-41169-0005 SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY FINE CHAMPAGNE
5442-41169-0006 LUSTIER ARE OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NILA IVANVI'S
5442-41168-0024 AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
5442-41168-0025 THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION
5442-41169-0010 THEN TWO ONE MUST KEEP UP CONNECTIONS
5442-41169-0008 WHY WHAT IS THAT TO UNDERSTAND
5442-41169-0009 THERE IS NO MEANING IN IT AT ALL
5442-41169-0011 IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT
5442-41169-0002 IS SUCH A BLACKGUARD
5442-41169-0015 IF WE' ARE LAYING OUT A GARDEN CLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU HAVE A TREE THAT STOOD A CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNAUGHTLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWER BEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
5442-41169-0021 WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEP UPON MISS SLIDTCH EVERYTHING THINGS WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDENS NEGLECTED
5442-41169-0019 AND ONCE MORE THE LANDOWNA WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
5442-41169-0014 THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
5442-41169-0023 HEARLY HAVE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BARK
5442-41169-0020 SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES IT
5442-41169-0013 THEIR PROPRIETERS OF A SORT BUT WE ARE THE LANDOWNERS
5442-41169-0018 OH WELL ONE DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
5442-41169-0024 YOUR MERIT I HEARD SAID THE LAND OWNERNER
5442-41169-0012 AND THEN TO TELL DIFFICULTE THERE'S ONE'S OWN INTEREST
5442-41169-0026 THE LAND ON CHOCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MOUSTACHES
5442-41169-0016 WELL AND HOW IS YOUR LAND DOING
5442-41169-0027 WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR BOX FOR TIMBERMBU
5442-41169-0022 TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THE LIBRARY
5442-41169-0017 BUT ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
5442-41169-0025 YES IT'S JUST STRANGE HE WENT ON
5484-24317-0001 BUT HARMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOR OF THE SEVENTEENIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRINER
5484-24317-0009 HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED AN IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF BE CONSPIRACY
5484-24317-0007 THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS A DOUBTS WHICH HAD ARISEED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
5484-24317-0004 THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
5484-24317-0005 HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
5484-24317-0006 SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUE DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MERTIIST HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
5442-41169-0030 THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
5484-24317-0008 THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
5484-24317-0002 SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
5484-24317-0011 THE PLACE BY  HERMAN'S SIDE WHICH AL HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSENNO
5484-24317-0010 WHEN HERMAN ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATIUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
5442-41169-0029 THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHT NOT TO DO
5484-24317-0003 SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION
5442-41169-0028 SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO HER THOUGHT THAT I'D STRUCK HIM
5484-24317-0000 WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PRO VISITED HIM AGAIN
5442-41169-0031 WITHOUT A RETURN TOO ADD A SIMPLE LOSS
5484-24317-0012 TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT AS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
5484-24317-0027 THE RODDIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSNO ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTURE'S ART WHEN CRATES HERMAND'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMETER WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WITCH TWO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
5484-24317-0017 WE WOMEN ARE EARLIE AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES ENTIRE WOMAN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HYPPUS AND AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
5484-24317-0014 CREATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSENO'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
5484-24317-0024 HE WINKED HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSENO HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYE HAD BEEN MADE IN  ROADS
5484-24317-0013 A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELL CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TI BOUND HIM SAVED THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
5484-24317-0018 THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMINGES THE LIEGE CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROLA
5484-24317-0025 THE A ROYALY LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
5484-24317-0015 HIS SON HAD BEEN THE ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LIMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
5484-24317-0020 YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISE WORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED AUSTTENO IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
5484-24317-0021 HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FROM THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
5484-24317-0019 LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING FOUR LEAVE WINE
5484-24317-0016 THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HARMON INCREDULOUSLY
5484-24317-0022 WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
5484-24317-0023 THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMANN
5484-24317-0026 HERAN LISTENED TO THE PARENT SILENCE
5484-24318-0001 TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMAN PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS ROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
5484-24317-0031 HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WAS STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
5484-24318-0008 BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS BEUS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS A FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
5484-24317-0032 THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION AND SNATH ME I CAN PROVE
5484-24317-0030 ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ANTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HARMONMOND'S REGARD
5484-24318-0007 IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMAN WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AN ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
5484-24317-0029 A WOMAN WHO EARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
5484-24318-0009 THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
5484-24317-0028 YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
5484-24318-0003 WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
5484-24318-0005 DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
5484-24317-0033 IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
5484-24318-0004 OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET HIS SUDDEN END AS A BOOM FROM THE IMMORTALS
5484-24318-0006 WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
5484-24318-0002 WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
5484-24318-0000 NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
5484-24318-0019 HE MIGHT NOW HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO BIND FOREVER TO HIS LIFE THE WOMAN WHO HAD JUST RESCUED HIM FROM THE GREATEST DANGER BY THE CONFESSION HE MUST MAKE TO HIS FELLOW ARTISTS IN THE PEELRE THE FOLLOWING MORNING STILL SEALED HIS LIPS YET IN THIS HOUR HE FELT THAT HE WAS UNITED TO HER AND OUGHT NOT TO CONCEAL WHAT AWAITED HIM SO OBEYING A STRONG IMPULSE HE EXCLAIMED YOU KNOW THAT I LOVE YOU
5484-24318-0017 AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH A WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
5484-24318-0013 LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
5484-24318-0012 SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
5484-24318-0016 DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPA'S SILENCED HER WITH A GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
5484-24318-0014 CRIED HERMAN IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
5484-24318-0011 AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
5484-24318-0022 BUT HERMAN WITH DROOPING HEAD MURMURED TO MORROW I SHALL NO LONGER BE WHAT I AM NOW
5484-24318-0023 THEN DAFNE RAISED HER FACE TO HIS ASKING SO THE DEMETER IS THE WORK OF MYRTLES
5484-24318-0015 TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
5484-24318-0018 IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE
5484-24318-0025 AND I FOOL BLINDED ALLALSO IN MIND COULD BE VEXED WITH YOU FOR IT
5484-24318-0021 DAPHNE EXCLAIMED TENDERLY WHAT MORE IT NEEDED
5484-24318-0024 WHAT A TERRIBLE ORDEAL AGAIN AWAITS YOU
5484-24318-0020 I LOVE YOU AND HAVE LOVED YOU ALWAYS
5484-24318-0010 YET IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
5484-24318-0034 THE EGYPTIAN OBEYED AND HIS MASTER CROSSED THE WIDE SPACE STREWN WITH SAND AND APPROACHED THE STAGE WHICH HAD BEEN ERECTED FOR THE FEASTAL PERFORMANCES EVEN HAD HIS EYES RETAINED THE POWER OF SIGHT HIS BLOOD WAS COURSING SO WIDELY THROUGH HIS VEINS THAT HE MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THE STATUES AROUND HIM AND THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WHO CROWDED CLOSELY TOGETHER RICHLY GARLANDED THEIR CHIEFS GLOWING WITH ENTHUSIASM SURROUNDED THE ARENA HERMON
5764-299665-0000 AFTERWARD IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT HE WAS SATISFIED WITH THE BLOOD OF OXEN LAMPS AND OFVES AND THAT IN EXCHANGE FOR OR IN ACCOUNT OF THESE SACRIFICES THIS GOD GAVE RAIN SUNSHINE AND HARVEST
5484-24318-0029 HIS HEART CONTRACTED PAINFULLY AND HIS SOLICITUDE ABOUT HIS UNCLE'S FATE INCREASED WHEN PHILIPUS INFORMED HIM THAT THE CONSPIRATORS HAD BEEN ARRESTED AT THE BANQUET AND HEADED BY AMENES THEHODIAN CHRYSIPPUS AND PROCLAS HAD PERISHED BY THE EXECUTIONER'S SWORD AT SUNRISE
5484-24318-0036 EVEN WHILE HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE CREATOR OF THE DEMEOR HE HAD BEEN SERIOUSLY TROUBLED BY THE PRAISE OF SO MANY CRITICS BECAUSE IT HAD EXPOSED HIM TO THE SUSPICION OF HAVING BECOME FAITHLESS TO HIS ART AND HIS NATURE
5484-24318-0026 BRING THIS BEFORE YOUR MIND AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT YOU MUST ACCEPT WITH IT IF YOU CONSENT WITH THE TIME ARRIVES TO BECOME MINE CONCEAL IN PALLIATE NOTHING
5484-24318-0037 HONOUR TO MYRCIUS AND HIS ART BUT HE TRUSTED THE NOBLE FEAST ILL ASSEMBLAGE WOULD PARDON THE UNINTENTIONAL DECEPTION AND AID HIS PRAYER FOR RECOVERY
5484-24318-0032 EVEN AFTERNE THESE IMAGE AND WHAT THREATENED HER FATHER AND HER WITH HIM REC SEATED FAR INTO THE BACKGROUND
5484-24318-0030 BESIDES HE KNEW THAT THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE WOULD NOT PART FROM HIM WITHOUT GRANTING HIM ONE LAST WORD
5484-24318-0035 SHOUTED HIS FRIEND SOIUS IN JOYFUL SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF HIS PAINFUL WALK HAIR MA
5484-24318-0028 HE HIMSELF ON THE WAY TO EXPOSE HIMSELF TO THE MALICE AND MOCKERY OF THE WHOLE CITY
5484-24318-0033 HE WAS APPEARING BEFORE HIS COMPANIONS ONLY TO GIVE TRUTH ITS JUST DUE
5484-24318-0027 SO SARCHIIS INTENDED TO LEAVE THE CITY ON ONE OF HIS OWN SHIPS THAT VERY DAY
5764-299665-0002 WHETHER AND A PRAYER WAS EVER ANSWERED
5764-299665-0001 WHETHER HE WAS THE CREATOR OF YOURSELF AND MYSELF
5764-299665-0003 WHY DID HE CREATE THE INTELLECTUALLY INFERIOR
5484-24318-0031 ON THE WAY HIS HEART THROBBED ALMOST TO BURSTING
5764-299665-0007 IS HE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CENTURIES OF SLAVERY FOR THE BACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SCARRED WITH A LASH FOR THE BABE THAT HAVE BEEN SOLD FROM THE BREASTS OF MOTHERS FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN SEPARATED AND DESTROYED
5764-299665-0014 DID INFINITE WITH THEM INTENTIONIALLY PRODUCE THE MICROSCOPIC BEASTS THAT FEED UPON THE OPPTTIC NURSE THINK OF BLINDING A MAN TO SATISFY THE APPETITE OF A MICROBE
5764-299665-0008 IS THIS GOD RESPONSIBLE FOR RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION FOR THE INQUISITION FOR THE TIME SCREW AND TRACKCK AND FOR ALL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
5764-299665-0017 LIPS PRELIES AND FEARFUL TREMBLINGLY REPEAT THIS PASSAGE THOUGH HE SLAY ME YET WILL I TRUST HIM
5764-299665-0004 WHY DID HE CREATE THE DEFORMED AND HELPLESS WHY DID HE CREATE THE CRIMINAL THE IDIOTIC THE INSANE
5764-299665-0012 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE WILD BEASTS THAT THE WAR HUMAN BEINGS FOR THE FANCED SERPENTS WHOSE BITE IS DEATH
5764-299665-0006 IS IRRESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE WALLS THAT HAVE BEEN WAGED FOR ALL THE INNOCENT BLOOD THAT HAS BEEN SHED
5764-299665-0011 CAN WE CONCEIVE OF A DEVIL BASE ENOUGH TO PREFER HIS ENEMIES TO HIS FRIENDS
5764-299665-0016 FEAR ERECTS THE CO CATHEDRAL AND BOWS THE HEAD OF MAN IN WORSHIP
5764-299665-0009 DID THEY'VE GOT THE LOAD THE CRUEL AND VILE TO DESTROY THE BRAVE AND VIRTUOUS
5764-299665-0013 HOW CAN WE ACCOUNT FOR A WORLD WILL LIE FEATS ON LIFE
5764-299665-0015 FEAR BEATS THE ALTAR AND OFFERS THE SACRIFICE
5764-299665-0019 CAN WE SAY THAT HIS MERCY ENDURED FOR EVER
5764-299665-0010 DID HE LOWE TYRANTS TO SHED THE BLOOD OF PATRIOTS
5764-299665-0005 ARE THE FAILURES UNDER OBLIGATION TO THEIR CREATOR
5764-299665-0018 CAN WE SAY THAT HE CARED FOR THE CHILDREN OF MEN
5764-299665-0020 DO WEROVE HIS GOODNESS BY SHOWING THAT HE HAS OPENED THE EARTH AND SWALLOWED THOUSAND OF HIS HELPLESS CHILDREN OR THAT WITH THE VOLCANOES HE HAS OVERWHELMED THEM WITH RIVERS OF FIRE
5764-299665-0032 IT IS INSISTED BY THESE THEOLOGIANS AND BY MANY OF THE SOUL CALLED PHILOSOPHERS THAT THIS MORAL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUTY OF OBLIGATION WAS IMPORTED AND THAT CONSCIENCE IS AN EXOTIC
5764-299665-0029 A CHILD SHONE BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FLAME GRASPED IT WITH HIS DIMPLED HAND
5764-299665-0030 THE POWER WOULD THAT WORK FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS HAD TAUGHT THE CHILD A LESSON
5764-299665-0022 ALL THE SUPERIOR RACE TO THANK GOD THAT THEY ARE NOT THE INFERIOR
5764-299665-0026 MAN ADVANCES AND NECESSARILY ADVANCES THROUGH EXPERIENCE
5764-299665-0027 A MAN WISHING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COME WHERE THE WORLD DIVIDES
5764-299665-0035 THEY ARE REGARDED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MORAL
5764-299665-0028 HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNOWS THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
5764-299665-0024 IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAGINE ANOTHER
5764-299665-0034 THEY ARE PRAISED ADMIRED AND RESPECTED
5764-299665-0033 WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAMILIES TRIBES AND NATIONS
5764-299665-0021 WAS THEIR GOODNESS WAS THEIR WISDOM IN THIS
5764-299665-0023 MOST PEOPLE CLK TO THE SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0025 WHAT IS THIS POWER
5764-299665-0031 IT IS A RESULT
5764-299665-0036 THE MEMBERS WHO ADD TO THE MISERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRIBE OF THE NATION ARE CONSIDERED BAD MEMBERSS
5764-299665-0037 THE GREATEST OF HUMAN BEINGS HAD SAID CONSCIENCE IS BORN OF LOVE
5764-299665-0049 COULD THERE HAVE BEEN WORSE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER RELIGION THAN CHRISTIANITY
5764-299665-0048 COULD THESE COUNTRIES HAVE BEEN WORSE WITHOUT RELIGION
5764-299665-0038 AS PEOPLE ADVANCE THE REMOTE CONSEQUENCES ARE PERCEIVED
5764-299665-0046 WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTROL WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPPIER
5764-299665-0043 IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPERNATURAL
5764-299665-0047 WHAT HAS RELIGION DONE FOR HUNGARY O AUSTRIA
5764-299665-0041 THE SENSE OF DUTY BECOMES STRONGER MORE IMPERATIVE
5764-299665-0050 WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR THEM
5764-299665-0044 MAN HAS DECEIVED HIMSELF
5764-299665-0040 A MAN PUTS HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER
5764-299665-0039 THE IMAGINATION IS CULTIVATED
5764-299665-0042 MAN JUDGES HIMSELF
5764-299665-0045 HAS CHRISTIANITY DONE GOOD
5764-299665-0051 THEY HATED PLEASURE
5764-299665-0066 RELIGION RESTS ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LISTEN TO PRAYER THAT HIS MASTER PUNISHNES AND WE REWARDS THAT HE LOVES PRAISE AND FLATTERY AND HATES THE BRAVE AND FREE
5764-299665-0054 THE PURITAN BELIEF THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THISIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
5764-299665-0056 THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ GERIN
5764-299665-0057 IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS IN FAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT
5764-299665-0055 LET ME REFER REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
5764-299665-0059 RELIGION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNTRIES IN ALL TIMES THU FAILED
5764-299665-0063 OUR CHRISTIAN MORE TEMPERED NEARER VIRTUOUS NEARERER HONEST THAN SAVAGES
5764-299665-0060 RELIGION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEMY OF SCIENCE OF INVESTIGATION AND THOUGHT
5764-299665-0062 IT HAS NEVER MADE MAN MORAL TEMPERATE INDUSTRIOUS AND HONEST
5764-299665-0053 THE RELIGION OF THE PURITAN WAS AN AN ADULTERATED CURSE
5764-299665-0065 CAN WE RECEIVE VIRTUE OR HUNGER AS ARMS
5764-299665-0058 HETERBURY BIBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GEORGEORG A KIND AND MERCIFUL
5764-299665-0064 CAN WE CUR DISEASE BY SUPPLICATION
5764-299665-0052 THEY MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF GLADNESS
5764-299665-0061 RELIGIONISTS NEVER MADE MEN FREE
5764-299665-0067 WE MUST HAVE CORN THE STONES
5764-299665-0072 IF THESE CORNSTONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM END TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
5764-299665-0073 IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR
5764-299665-0080 WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UNIVERSE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURALLY PRODUCED
5764-299665-0074 IT FOLLOWED THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELLIGENCE AND A DESIGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
5764-299665-0071 THE FIRST STONE IS THAT MATTER SUBSTANCE CANNOT BE DESTROYED CANNOT BE ANNIHILATED
5764-299665-0078 IN THE INFINITE CHANGERIES AND THERE CAN BE NO BROKEN NO MISSINGLING
5764-299665-0083 FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRYING TO REFORM THE WORLD
5764-299665-0070 I HAVE A THEORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORN STONES
5764-299665-0082 WE KNOW THE FOOTSTEPS OF ADVANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRAD
5764-299665-0079 WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PARENTS WERE NOT FOREIGNERS
5764-299665-0077 THAT WHICH HATH NOT HAPPENED COULD NOT
5764-299665-0069 IF WE BUILD WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BOTTOM
5764-299665-0075 I SAY WHAT I THINK
5764-299665-0081 WE KNOW THE PARTS THAT LIFE HAS TRAVELLED
5764-299665-0068 THE STRUCTURE MUST HAVE ABASMENT
5764-299665-0076 EVERY EVEN HAS PARENTS
5764-299665-0097 IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FAULTS AND BARRICADES OF FEAR TO STAND ERECT AND FAITH THE FUTURE WITOUS MIND
6070-63485-0000 THERERE DONE FAR SAID THE SCHOOLMASTER IN THE LOKI TO THEETTE OUT WITH YOUR VITRIOL AND MIND YOUR EYE
5764-299665-0090 WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE BURDEN AND CURSES WHY
6070-63485-0001 THE TWO MONSTERS TOOK OFF THEIR SHOES AND MOVED STEALTHILY ALONG KEEPING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE HOUSES
5764-299665-0088 NATURE PRODUCED WITHOUT PURPOSE SUSTAINS WITHOUT INTENTION AND DESTROYS WITHOUT THOUGHT
5764-299665-0092 LAW CAN PUNISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REFORM CRIMINALS NOR PREVENT CRIME
5764-299665-0086 THEY LEAVE BY FRAUD AND VIOLENCE AND BEQUEATH THEIR VICES TO THEIR CHILDREN
5764-299665-0085 THEY DEPEND ON THE LOT ON UNLUCK AND CHARITY
5764-299665-0087 FAILURE SEEMS TO BE THE TRADEMARK OF NATURE WHY
5764-299665-0089 MUST THE WORLD FOR EVER REMAIN THE VICTIM OF IGNORANT PASSION
5764-299665-0091 PASSION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DEAF
5764-299665-0096 POVERTY AND CRIME WILL BE CHILDLESS
5764-299665-0094 THIS IS THE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE QUESTION
5764-299665-0093 THESE CANNOT BE DONE BY TALK OR EXAMPLE
5764-299665-0084 WHY HAVE THE REFORMAL FAITH

6070-86744-0003 I CAN SCARCELY CREDIT IT
6070-86744-0018 HE DWELT WITH CONSIDERABLE FORCE AND ENERGY ON THE ALMOST MAGICAL HOSPITALITY HAD RECEIVED FROM THE COUNT AND THE MAGNIFICENCE OF HIS ENTERTAINMENT IN THE GROTTO OF THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS HE RECOUNTED WITH CIRCUMSTANTIAL EXACTITUDE ALL THE PARTICULARS OF THE SUPPER THE HASHISH THE STATUES THE DREAM AND HOW AT HIS AWAKENING THERE REMAINED NO PROOF OUR TRACE OF ALL THESE EVENTS SAVE THE SMALL YAD SEEN IN THE DISTANTISONON DRIVING UNDER FULL SAL TOWARD PORT OR VECU

6070-86744-0019 THEN HE DETAILED THE CONVERSATION OVERHEARD BY HIM AT THE COLISSEUM BETWEEN THE COUNT AND VAMPA IN WHICH THE COUNT HAD PROMISED TO OBTAIN THE RELEASE OF THE BANDED PEPPINO AN ENGAGEMENT WHICH AS OUR READERS ARE AWARE HE MOST FAITHFULLY FULFILLED
6070-86745-0000 THEN SHOULD ANYTHING APPEAR TO MERIT A MORE MINUTE EXAMINATION ALBERT DE MORCERF WOULD FOLLOW UP HIS RESEARCHES BY MEANS OF A SMALL GATE SIMILAR TO THAT CLOSEUS TO THE CONCIERGE'S DOOR AND WHICH MERITS A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION
6070-86744-0026 I CONFESS HE ASKED ME NONE NO HE MERELY CAME AND FREED ME FROM THE HANDS OF SIGNOR VAMPA WHERE I CAN ASSURE YOU IN SPITE OF ALL MY OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF EASE AND AND CONCERN I DID NOT VERY PARTICULARLY CARE TO REMAIN

6070-86744-0015 I WILL CONFESS TO YOU ALBERT REPLIED FRANZ THE COUNT IS A VERY SINGULAR PERSON AND THE APPOINTMENT YOU HAVE MADE TO MEET HIM IN PARIS FILLS ME WITH A THOUSAND APPREHENSIONS
6070-86744-0027 AND THIS TIME IT MUST BE CONFESSED TO THAT CONTRAURE THE USUAL STATE OF AFFAIRS IN DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE YOUNG MEN THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS WERE ALL ON ALBERT'S SIDE

6070-86744-0029 AND NOW MY DEAR FRANZ LET US TALK OF SOMETHING ELSE
6070-86744-0021 WHY REALLY THE THING SEEMS TO MAKE SIMPLE ENOUGH
6070-86744-0016 DID YOU EVER MEET HIM PREVIOUSLY TO COMING HITHER
6070-86744-0017 UPON MY HONOUR THEN LISTEN TO ME
6070-86745-0002 AT A QUARTER TO TEN THE VALLEYT ENTERED HE COMPOSED WITH A LITTLE ROOM NAMED JOHN AND WHO ONLY SPOKE KING ENGLISH ALL ALBERT'S ESTABLISHMENT ALLTHOUGH THE COOK OF THE HOTEL WAS ALWAYS AT HIS SERVICE AND ON GREAT OCCASIONS THE COUNT'S CHASSEUR ALSO
6070-86745-0001 SHRUBS AND CREEPING PLANTS COVERED THE WINDOWS AND HID FROM THE GARDEN AND CAUGHT THESE TWO APARTMENTS THE ONLY ROOMS INTO WHICH AS THEY WERE ON THE GROUND FLOOR THE PRYING EYES OF THE CURIOUS COULD PENETRATE
6070-86745-0012 I RETURNED HOME AT DAYBREAK AND STROVE TO SLEEP BUT MY HEAD ACHED AND I GOT UP TO HAVE A RIDE FOR AN HOUR
6070-86745-0013 PESTS I WILL DO NOTHING OF THE KIND THE MOMENT THEY COME FROM GOVERNMENT YOU WOULD FIND THEM EXECRABLE

6070-86745-0003 WAIT THEN DURING THE DAY TELL ROSA THAT WHEN I LEAVE THE OPERA I WILL SUP WITH HER AS SHE WISH IT
6070-86745-0007 GOOD MORNING ENGLISH GOOD MORNING SAID ALBERT YOUR PUNCTUALITY REALLY ALARMS ME
6070-86745-0010 YES HE HAS NOT MUCH TO COMPLAIN OF BORRGE IS THE CAPITAL OF CHARLES THE SEVENTH
6070-86745-0016 IN THE ENTIRE POLITICAL WORLD OF WHICH YOU ARE ONE OF THE LEADERS
6070-86745-0014 BESIDES THAT DOES NOT CONCERN THE HOME BUT THE FINANCIAL DEPARTMENT
6070-86745-0009 NO NO MY DEAR FELLOW DO NOT CONFOUND OUR PLANS
6070-86745-0011 IT IS FOR THAT REASON YOU SEE ME SO EARLY
6070-86745-0004 VERY WELL AT HALF PAST TEN
6070-86745-0015 ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE PAPERS
6070-86745-0005 IS THE COUNTESS UP YET
6070-86745-0006 THE VALET LEFT THE ROOM
6128-63240-0008 AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANCE AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ALLEGIANS AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASK IN TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPPOSE OF THE COTTONFIELD
6128-63240-0006 THOSE OF BASAL MANSON WENT DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS FECHIA IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE ME
6128-63240-0004 HE WAS TALL AND LEAN AND DRESSED THROUGHOUT IN BLACK HIS SHIRT COLLAR WAS LOW AND WIDE AND THE TRIANGLE OF LINEN A LITTLE CRUMPLED EXHIBITED BY THE OPENING OF HIS WAISTCOAT WAS ADORNED BY A PIN CONTAINING A SMALL RED STONE
6128-63240-0007 THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIRSMODERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THERE MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
6128-63240-0000 THE GENTLEMAN HAD NOT EVEN NEEDED TO SIT DOWN TO BECOME INTERESTED APPARENTLY HE HAD TAKEN UP THE VOLUME FROM A TABLE AS SOON AS HE CAME IN AND STANDING THERE AFTER A SINGLE GLANCE ROUND THE APARTMENT HAD LOST HIMSELF IN HIS PAGES
6128-63240-0005 IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HAIRED AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
6128-63240-0010 WELL SO IT IS THEY ARE ALL WITCHES AND WIZARDS MEDIUMS AND SPIRIT RAPPES AND ROARING MEDICALS
6128-63240-0009 AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM
6070-86745-0017 THEY SAY THAT IT IS QUITE FAIR AND THAT SEWING SO MUCH RED YOU OUGHT TO REAP A LITTLE BLUE
6128-63240-0003 JUST AS I AM THE VISITOR INQUIRED PRESENTING HIMSELF WITH RATHER AWARE COULD A ASPECT
6128-63240-0011 IF YOU' ARE GOING TO DINE WITH HER YOU HAD BETTER KNOW IT OH MURDER
6070-86745-0019 WITH YOUR TALENTS YOU WOULD MAKE YOUR FORTUNE IN THREE OR FOUR YEARS
6128-63240-0001 THAT HAS AN UNFLATTERING SOUND FOR ME SAID THE YOUNG MAN
6128-63240-0012 HE LOOKED AT MISSUS LUNA WITH INTELLIGENT INCREDULITY
6070-86745-0018 COME COME THAT IS NOT BAD SAID LUCIA
6128-63240-0002 SHE IS WHENIN TO REST THAT
6128-63240-0024 HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNAR'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
6128-63240-0023 SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AND MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
6128-63241-0000 POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BEATOCIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
6128-63240-0025 HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE CALLED AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
6128-63240-0027 MISSUS LOUNY'S FAMILYITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANCELLORLOW THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGEAGE
6128-63240-0017 THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE THAT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LENA
6128-63240-0026 I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WHERE DON' DO YOU THEOP PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
6128-63240-0021 BESIDES I LIV DIDN'T WANT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
6128-63240-0019 AND MISSUS LENA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
6128-63240-0013 SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATTER
6128-63240-0022 THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH ALL LIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS
6128-63240-0018 ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WEAR
6128-63240-0016 SHE HATES IT SHE WILL LIKE TO ABOLISH IT
6128-63240-0020 ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR
6128-63240-0015 NO I HAVEN'T BEEN ANYWHERE
6128-63240-0014 HAVE YOU BEEN IN EUROPE
6128-63241-0006 THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SINED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PRONCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS PUCKET AND GNARING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
6128-63241-0011 SHE WAS PERFECTLY SAFE AFTER WRITING TO BAZL RANSOM AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THANK HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPTIONALLY SUPERLATIVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASSURE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BOSTON
6128-63241-0013 OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONTENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE FOR IT ALWAYS COST HER TEARS HEADACHES A DAY OR TWO IN BED ACUTEION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE BAISER RANSOM WOULD NOT CARE TO CONTEND
6128-63241-0001 THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIMB AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNA'S SISTER
6128-63241-0010 SHE HAD ERECTED IT INTO A SORT OF RULE OF CONDUCT THAT WHENEVER SHE SAW A RISK SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FREQUENT HUMILIATIONS AT FINDING HERSELF SAFED AFTER ALL
6128-63241-0004 SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
6128-63241-0007 IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BALILESER RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
6128-63241-0005 HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
6128-63241-0008 IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RANSOM MONEY OR EVEN CLOTHES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF A ASCERTAIN IN HER SUCH AN SUFFERING WOULD BE TAKEN
6128-63241-0003 HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
6128-63244-0000 MISS CHANCELLORER HERSELF THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VITAL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARKS AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPERIENCES
6128-63241-0002 RANSON WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIIAL
6128-63241-0012 HE WAS TOO SIMPLE TOO MISSISSIPPION FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPPOINTED
6128-63241-0009 OLI HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREATEST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
6128-63244-0001 HOW DID THE LADIES UN BEACON STREET FEEL ABOUT THE BURIT
6128-63244-0002 PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FALSE SOME OTHERS
6128-63244-0014 AND LOOK AFTER THE DETAILS AS WELL AS THE BIG CURRANTS MISSUS FARINDER ADDED IN A TURN AS EXLANARY AS COULD BE EXPECTED OF SUCH A WOMAN AND WITH THE SMILE OF WHICH THE SWEETNESS WAS THRILLING TO HER LISTENER
6128-63244-0006 SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BOSTON HIRA KEYY AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FARINGNDER SUPPOSED SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERSPECTIVE IN TALKING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN HER REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ARISTOCRACY
6128-63244-0017 IT WAS ONE THING TO CHOOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW IN THE GREAT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EN INFANTISEMENT OF THEIR SEX FROM EVERY FORM OF BANDAGE HAD CHOSEN FOR HER
6128-63244-0009 CHAR WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WIDE OVERCOAT AND A PAPER COLLAR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST NICES THAT THE CARED MUCH THE MOST
6128-63244-0005 THOS THE SORTS OF CLEAR YOUR PEOPLE LIVE THERE AND SO BRILLIANT A WOMAN AS MISSUS FARRINDER WHO LIVED AT BRXBURY OUGHT NOT TO MIX THINGS UP
6128-63244-0004 OLIAM HATED DEAR THAT FINE AVENUE TALKED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARKABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WITH A PROOF OF WORLDLY GLORY
6128-63244-0003 WITH HER IMMENSE SYMPATHY FOR REFORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISHING THATFALLN AS WERE IN LITTLE DIFFERENT
6128-63244-0007 SHE WISHED TO ACT IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PREOCCUPIED WITH THE A ROMANCE OF THE PEOPLE
6128-63244-0008 THIS MIGHT SEE ONE OF THE MOST ACCESSIBLE OF PLEASURES BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
6128-63244-0015 SAID BALISH CHANCELLOR WITH A FACE WHICH SEEMED TO PLEAD FOR A REMISSIONOUS RE RESPONSIBILITY
6128-63244-0011 IF IT BE NECESSARY WE'RE PREPARED TO TAKE SENTENCE STEPS TO CONCILIATE THE SHRINKING
6128-63244-0010 ON THE CHANCELLOR WONDERED HOW MISSUS VINEDO WOULD TREAT THEIR BRANCH OF THE QUESTION
6128-63244-0012 OUR MOVEMENT IS FOR ALL ITLL BE ALSO THE MOST DELICATE LADIES
6128-63244-0013 BRING IS DISUNDED AMONG THEM AND BRING ME YOUR THOUSAND NAMES

6128-63244-0022 IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTERESTING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SACRIFICE AS THIS LAST WHO WOULD BE REQUIRED OF HER BUT SHE SOLD A MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUNRISE MISTATION WHICH MADE DANGER AS ROSY IS SUCCESS
6432-63722-0004 AND HAVING PUT HIMSELF IN A FAIR WAY AS HE HOPED TO SOLVE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH THE DARCY CASE COLONEL ASHLEY WENT DOWN TO POLICE HEADQUARTERS TO LEARN MORE FACTS IN THE CONNECTION WITH THE MURDER OF THE EAST INDIAN
6128-63244-0021 THERE WOULD BE NAMES OF WOMEN WHEAT INSULTED PERSECUTED BUT DEVOTEDED IN EVERY PUL OF THEIR BEING TO THE CAUSE AND ASKING NO BETTER FATE THAN TO DIE FOR IT
6128-63244-0024 OLILIVE CHANCELLOR LOOKED AT HER WITH LOVE REMEMBERED THAT SHE HAD NEVER IN HER LONG IN REWARDED WEARY LIFE HAD A THOUGHT OF AN IMPULSE FOR HERSELF
6128-63244-0023 WHEN MISS BIRD'S EYE APPROACHED IT TRANSFIGURED HER FAMILIAR HE COMICAL SHAPE AND MADE THE POOR LITTLEITARY HACK SIMPLEREADY A MARTYR
6128-63244-0025 SHE HAD BEEN CONSUMED BY THE PASSION OF SYMPATHY IT HAD CRUMPLED HER INTO AS MANY CREASES AS AN OLD GLAZED DISTENDED GLOVE
6432-63722-0001 AND SHAG WITH THE FREEDOM OF AN OLD SERVANT STOOD LOOKING AT HIS MASTER AS IF NOT QUITE UNDERSTANDING THE NEW TWIST THE AFFAIRS HAD TAKEN
6432-63722-0006 KAL WAS TOO MUCH ENGAGED IN WATCHING THE BLUE SMOKE GIRL LAZILY UPWARD FROM HIS CIGAR JUST THEN TO SAY MORE

6432-63722-0019 I HAPPENED TO SEE THOSE CANDLESTICKS IN THE WINDOW OF SINGA FUUT'S SHOP THE OTHER DAY AND I MADE UP MY MIND TO BUY THEM WHEN I HAD A CHANCE
6432-63722-0021 FRUT I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S HIS FIRST OR HIS LAS NAME ANYHOW HE HAD A PARTNERTER NAMED SHEER ALI

6432-63722-0015 GAD EXPLAINED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0037 AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEAD PENCIL
6432-63722-0025 HE FOUND THE PLACE WITHOUT A LIGHT IN IT STUMBLED OVER SOMETHING ON THE FLOOR AND THERE WAS ALLI'S BODY WITH THE HEAD BUSTED IN AND THIS HEAVY CANDLESTICK NEAR IT
6432-63722-0027 MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOS TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYING I SEE
6432-63722-0036 THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL HAS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
6432-63722-0035 BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NODDED DESIR COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY'LL HAVE THEERN

6432-63722-0032 YES IT MAY HAVE SOME ROUGH EDGES ON IT
6432-63722-0045 I WANT TO TALK OVER DARCY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD TALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
6432-63722-0048 AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PRON BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
6432-63722-0047 RATHER A HYP PATHTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION
6432-63722-0046 WHAT ARE THE CHURCHS OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
6432-63722-0051 BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING OUT FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK

6432-63723-0007 IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF A BASER SORT
6432-63723-0008 YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
6432-63723-0000 CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
6432-63723-0004 HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FINISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
6432-63723-0006 IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
6432-63722-0058 NO ALIMONY REPLIED THE COLONEL PUZZLED YES JUST THAT
6432-63723-0010 AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTED GREAT CONFIRMED
6432-63723-0011 HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
6432-63723-0012 SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
6432-63723-0002 THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNETH
6432-63723-0009 THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
6432-63723-0005 WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
6432-63722-0059 AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
6432-63723-0003 NO I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT
6432-63722-0057 YES IT STILL HOLDS GOOD
6432-63723-0021 GRAVE AND EVEN REVEREND THE CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALL ROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
6432-63723-0028 AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LAR HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVEIFICATIONS
6432-63723-0019 THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELLER WAS TRIED

7018-75789-0012 SO I CONSORTED WITH THE CHIEF OF THE ISLANDERS AND THEY PAID ME THE UTMOST RESPECT
7018-75789-0010 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY SECOND NIGHT
7018-75789-0000 WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FIRST NIGHT
7018-75789-0006 BUT I WAS DELIGHTED AT MY ESCAPE FROM THE RIVER
7018-75789-0029 THIS HE SET IN A SAUCER WETTED WITH A LITTLE WATER AND AFTER WAITING A SHORT TIME SMELT AND TASTED IT AND THEN HE TOOK OUT OF THE CHEST A BOOKLET WHEREIN HE READ A WHILE AND SAID WEEPING KNOW O YE PASSENGERS THAT IN THIS BOOK IS A MARVELLOUS MATTER DENOTING THAT WHOSO COME THITHER SHALL SURELY DIE WITHOUT HOPE OF ESCAPE FOR THAT THIS OCEAN IS CALLED THE SEA OF THE CLIMBE OF THE KING WHEREIN IS A SEPULCHRE OF OUR LORD'S SOLOMON SON OF DAVID ON BOTH BE PEACE

7018-75789-0031 WHEN SUDDENLY A VIOLENT SQUALL OF WIND AROSE AND SMOTE THE SHIP WHICH ROSE OUT OF THE WATER AND SETTLED UPON A GREAT REEF THE HAUNT OF SEA MONSTERS WHERE IT BROKE UP AND FELL ASUNDER INTO PLANKS AND ALL AND EVERYTHING ON BOARD WERE PLUNGED INTO THE SEA
7018-75789-0018 FOR STATE PROCESSIONS ARE THROWN IS SET FOR HIM UPON A HUGE ELEPHANT ELEVEN CUBBERT'S HIGH AND UPON THIS HE SITTETH HAVING HIS GREAT LORDS AND OFFICERS AND GUESTS STANDING IN TWO RANKS ON HIS RIGHT HAND AND ON HIS LEFT
7018-75789-0024 SHE SAID IT HATH REACHED ME O AUSPICIOUS KING THAT WHEN SINDBAD THE SEAMAN HAD RELATED THE HISTORY OF WHAT BEFELL HIM IN HIS SIXTH VOYAGE AND ALL THE COMPANY HAD DISPERSED SINDBAD THE LANDSMAN WENT HOME AND SLEPT AS OF WANT
7018-75789-0020 PRESENTLY MY FRIENDS CAME TO ME AND I DISTRIBUTED PRESENCES AMONG MY FAMILY AND GAVE ARMS IN LARGESS AFTER WHICH I YIELDED MYSELF TO JOYANCE AND ENJOYMENT MIRTH AND MERRYMAKING AND FORGOT ALL THAT I HAD SUFFERED

7018-75789-0025 THE SEVENTH VOYAGE OF SINBAD THE SEAMAN
7105-2330-0003 OF COURSE ANY SENTENCE WHICH THE LAW MIGHT FEEL COMPELLED TO INFLICT WOULD BE FOLLOWED BY AN IMAGE AT PARDON BUT IT WAS HIGHLY DESIRABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENTS POINT OF VIEW THAT THE NECESSITY FOR SUCH AN EXERCISE OF CLEMENCY SHOULD NOT ARISE
7105-2330-0002 VICTORY JUY COULD NOT POSSIBLY FIND THAT THE PRISONER HAD NOT DELIBERATELY AND INTENTIONALLY BLOWN UP THE ALBERT HALL THE QUESTION WAS COULD THEY FIND ANY EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH COULD PERMIT OF AN ACQUITTAL
7105-2330-0001 HE HAD NOT ONLY PLEADED GUILTY BUT HAD EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF REPEATING HIS ESCAPADE IN OTHER DIRECTIONS AS SOON AS CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED THROUGHOUT THE TRIAL HE WAS BUSY EXAMINING A SMALL MODEL OF THE FREE TRADE HALL IN MANCHESTER

7105-2340-0007 FROM HIS LATE SCHOOL DAYS ONWARD HE HAD BEEN POSSESSED BY AN ACUTE AND OBSTINATE FORM OFLEPTIMANIA HE HAD THE ACQUISITIVE INSTINCT OF THE COLLECTOR WITHOUT ANY OF THE COLLECTOR'S DISCRIMINATION
7105-2340-0013 OH WE HAVEN'T SHOWN YOU THE SILVER WEDDING PRESENTS SAID MISSUS PETER SUDDENLY AS THOUGH STRUCK BY A BRILLIANT IDEA FOR ENTERTAINING THE GUEST HERE THEY ALL ARE
7105-2340-0021 HOW ON EARTH ARE WE TO KNOW SAID PETER THE MEAN PIG HASN'T BROUGHT US A PRESENT AND I'M HANGED IF HE SHALL CARRY ONE OFF

7105-2340-0018 I PUT IT DOWN BY THE CLA SAID WILFRID BUSY WITH ANOTHER OBJECT
7105-2340-0012 IN THE DRAWING ROOM AFTER DINNER THEIR NERVOUSNESS AND AWKWARDNESS INCREASED
7105-2340-0011 THE TALK FLITTED NERVOUSLY AND HURRIEDLY FROM ONE IMPERSONAL TOPIC TO ANOTHER
7105-2340-0010 I SUPPOSE IS BRINGING AS A PEASANT FOR THE SILVER WEDDING GOOD GRACIOUS
7105-2340-0014 SUCH NICE USEFUL GIFTS A FEW DUPLICATES OF COURSE
7105-2340-0019 VIGILANCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY CROWNED WITH A SENSE OF VICTORY
7105-2340-0015 SEVEN CREAM JUGS PUT IN PETER
7105-2340-0017 OF COURSE SOME OF THEM CAN BE CHANGED
7105-2340-0016 WE FEEL THAT WE MUST LIVE UNC CREAM FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES
7105-2340-0006 AND THE REPUTATION WAS AN UNPLEASANT ONE
7105-2340-0009 SIGN WILFRIDED PEAECHECHON
7105-2340-0030 IT WAS MISSUS PETER WHO ARRIVED FIRST AT AN INSPIRATION HOW DREADFUL TO THINK THERE ARE THIEVES IN THE HOUSE WE KEEP THE DRAWING ROOM LOCKED UP AT NIGHT OF COURSE BUT ANYTHING MIGHT BE CARRIED OFF WHILE WE ARE AT BREAKFAST
7105-2340-0026 I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT TO YOU LAST NIGHT AFTER DINNER ON IT HAPPENED TO BE A CREAM JUG AND YOU SEEMED ANNOYED AT HAVING SO MANY DUPLICATES SO I FELT RATHER OF GIVING YOU ANOTHER
7105-2340-0031 SHE ROSE AND WENT OUT HURRIEDLY AS THOUGH TO ASSURE HERSELF THAT THE DRAWING ROOM WAS NOT BEING STRIPPPED OF ITS SILVERWARE AND RETURNED A MOMENT LATER BEARING A CREAM JUG IN HER HANDS
7105-2340-0024 IT'S AN AN UNPLEASANT THING TO HAVE TO SAY HE BLURTED OUT PRESENTLY BUT I'M AFRAID YOU MUST HAVE A THIEF AMONG YOUR SERVANTS SOMETHING'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF MY PORTMANTEAU
7105-2340-0028 LADY ERNESTTON PEAECH ANDCOTE HIS MOTHER MOVED IN CIRCLES WHICH WERE ENTIRELY BEYOND THEIR COMPASS OR AMBITIONS AND THE SON WOULD PROBABLY ONE DAY BE AN AMBASSADOR
7105-2340-0033 PETER DASHED OUT OF THE ROOM WITH GLAD RELIEF HE HAD LIVED SO LONG DURING THE LAST FEW MINUTES THAT A GOLDEN WEDDING SEEMED WITHINMEASURABLE DISTANCE
7105-2340-0032 THE KITCHENE COATS HAD TURNED PALER THAN EVER MISSUS PETER HAD A FINAL INSPIRATION
7105-2340-0023 WILFRID WAS LAID IN COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND HIS MANNER SHOWED PLAINLY THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS
7105-2340-0037 BRAVE LITTLE WOMAN SAID BITTER WITH A GASP OF RELIEF I COULD NEVER HAVE DONE IT
7105-2340-0035 PETER'S LITTLE WEAKNESS HE TRANSSID THE FAMILY GOOD LORD
7105-2340-0025 IT WAS A LITTLE PRESENT FROM MY MOTHER AND MYSELF FOR YOUR SILVER WEDDING
7105-2340-0036 DO YOU MEAN TO SAY HE IS ACLEPTTOINIA LIKE COUSINS SNATCHER
7105-2340-0029 HUSBAND AND WIFE LOOKED BLANKLY AND DESPERATELY AT ONE ANOTHER
7105-2340-0034 MISSUS PETER TURNED TO HER GUEST WITH CONFIDENTIAL KINDNESS
7105-2340-0027 THIS SNATCH HAD BEEN AN ORPHAN THIS MANY YEARS
7105-2340-0022 IS THE ONLY THING TO DO
7902-96591-0008 HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOIR PROPER AS THE PRINCE CALL A LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARIBALD RAY STROKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
7902-96591-0014 THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
7902-96591-0015 TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP LOS THE BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SURGING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
7902-96591-0007 THEN AS ARCHIE STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
7902-96591-0012 FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
7902-96591-0010 COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
7902-96591-0013 NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT
7902-96591-0002 AND AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
7902-96591-0009 AND ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD

7902-96592-0003 STOP HERE TILL SIR RISDON COMES DOWN AND TELL HIM I'M VERY SORRY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CLEARED OUT LAST NIGHT ONLY A BORN FOOL SAW JERRY AND ANDDY'S LOBSTER BOAT COMING INTO THE COVE AND CAME RUNNING TO SAY IT WAS A PARTY FROM THE CUTTER YES FATHER
7902-96591-0020 SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS AND THE HOSE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
7902-96592-0005 THE DULL SOUND OF DEPARTING STEPS AND A LOW WHISTLING SOUND COMING DOWN THROUGH THE SKYLIGHT WINDOW INTO THE CABIN WHERE ARCHY RACE STROKE LAY WITH HIS HEAVY EYELIDS PRESSED DOWN BY SLEEP
7902-96591-0017 NEXT MOMENT AS HE FELT HIS WAY ABOUT HIS HAND TOUCHED AN OLD FASHIONED MARBLE MANTELPIECE FIREPLACE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0016 THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL
7902-96591-0022 HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
7902-96591-0024 A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
7902-96592-0004 TELL HIM NOT TO BE UNEASY TIS ALL RIGHT AND I'LL HAVE EVERYTHING CLEAR AWAY TO NIGHT
7902-96592-0000 SURE YOU' LOOK ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER QUITE
7902-96591-0023 BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
7902-96591-0018 YES IF OTHER WAYS FAILED HE COULD ESCAPE UP THE CHIMNEY
7902-96591-0021 A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO PLACES
7902-96592-0002 SHALL I COME TO FATHER NO
7902-96592-0006 WHAT A QUEER DREAM HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF

7902-96592-0014 OH THOSE BARS HE MENTALLY EXCLAIMED AND HE WAS ADVANCING TOWARDS THEM WHEN JUST AS HE DREW NEAR THERE WAS A RUSTLING NOISE UNDER THE WINDOW A COUPLE OF HANDS SEIZED THE BARS THERE WAS A SCRATCHING OF BOOTES AGAINST STONEWORK AND RAM'S FACE APPEARED TO GAZE INTO THE ROOM BY INTENTION BUT INTO THE ASTONISHED COUNTENANCE OF THE YOUNGSHIPMAN INSTEAD
7902-96592-0012 WHAT DID THEY SAY FALSE ALARM TILL SIR RISDON THEY WOULD CLEAR ALL WAY TO NIGHT SEE IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN LEFT ABOUT LOBSTER WROTE

7902-96592-0009 THERE WAS AN INTERVAL OF THINKING OVER THIS KNOTTY QUESTION DURING WHICH THE LOW WHISTLING WENT ON
7902-96592-0013 ONCE OUT OF THAT ROOM HE COULD RAN AND BY DAYLIGHT THE SMUGGS DARE NOT HUNT HIM DOWN

7902-96592-0030 THE RESULT WAS NOT VERY SATISFACTORY BUT SUFFICIENTLY SO TO MAKE HIM ESSAY THE BAR OF THE WINDOW ONCE MORE PRODUCING A GRATING EAR ACEING SOUND AS HE FOUND THAT NOW HE DID MAKE A LITTLE IMPRESSION SO LITTLE THOUGH THAT THE PROBABILITY WAS IF HE KEPT ON WORKING WELL FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS HE WOULD NOT GET THROUGH
7902-96592-0028 A HAPPY INSPIRATION HAD COME AND PLACING ONE HAND UPON HIS CHEST HE THRUST IN THE OTHER GAVE A TUG AND DREW OUT HIS LITTLE CURVED DIRK GLANCED AT THE EDGE RAN TO THE WINDOW AND BEGAN TO CUT AT ONE OF THE BARS LABOR IN VAIN
7902-96592-0029 HE DIVIDED THE PAINT AND PRODUCED A FEW SQUEAKS IN GRATING SOUNDS AS HE REALIZED THAT THE ATTEMPT WAS MADNESS
7902-96592-0026 HE HAS GONE TO GIVE THE ALARM THOUGHT THE PRISONER AND HE LOOKED EXCITEDLY ROUND FOR A WAY OF ESCAPE

8131-117016-0008 THE PRESSURE WAS ENOUGH TO GET THEM FOR HIM
8131-117016-0019 NOBODY HAD TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH HIM
8131-117016-0016 TWO YEARS GORDON ADMITTED
8131-117016-0021 MOVING IN TWO GROUPS OF THREES AT OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE STREET THEY BEGAN THEIR BEAT

8131-117016-0032 MURDOCK INDICATED ONE WHO STOOD WITH HIS SHOULDERS SHAKING IN TEARS RUNNING DOWN HIS CHEEKS
8131-117016-0023 GORDON FELT THE SOLID PLEASURE OF THE FINELY TURNED CLUB IN HIS HANDS
8131-117016-0036 MURDOCK TOOK HIS NOD AS EVIDENCE ENOUGH AND TURNED TO THE WRETCHED TUFTS
8131-117016-0034 I WANT THE NAME OF EVERY MAN IN THE GANG YOU CAN REMEMBER HE TOLD THE MAN
8131-117016-0025 HE SWALLOWED THE SENTIMENT HIS OWN CLUB WAS MOVING NOW
8131-117016-0022 THERE WAS NO CHANCE TO SAVE THE CITIZEN WHO WAS DYING FROM LACK OF AIR
8131-117016-0030 WE'RE NOT USING WAGONS MURDDOCK TOLD HIM LINE THEM UP
8131-117016-0028 THEY ROUNDED UP THE MEN OF THE GANG AND ONE OF THE CUPS STARTED OFF
8131-117016-0027 HE BROUGHT HIM TO THE GROUND WITH A SINGLE BLOW ACROSS THE KIDNEYS
8131-117016-0033 THE CAPTAIN'S FACE WAS AS SICK AS GORDON'S FELT
8131-117016-0035 COLONEL THEY'D KILL ME I DON'T KNOW
8131-117016-0026 THE OTHER FOUR COPS HAD COME IN RELUCTANTLY
8131-117016-0029 TO FIND A PHONEE AND CALL THE WAGON
8131-117016-0024 GORDON'S EYES POPPED AT THAT
8131-117016-0052 AND THEN HELL IS GOING TO POP AND THIS WHOLE PLANET MAY BE BLOWN WIDE OPEN

8131-117016-0042 BUT THE CAPTAIN STIRRED FINALLY SIGHING
8131-117016-0038 TROUBLE BEGAN BREWING SHORTLY AFTER THOUGH

8131-117016-0050 EVER SEE A MARTIAN ELECTION
8131-117017-0000 IT WAS NIGHT OUTSIDE AND THE PHOSPHOBOLBS OF THE CORNERS GLOWED DIMLY GIVING HIM BARELY ENOUGH LIGHT BY WHICH TO LOCATATEE THE WAY TO THE EXTEMPORZED PRECINCT HOUSEUS
8131-117017-0002 AND THE SLOW DOUBTFUL RESPECT ON THE FACES OF THE CITIZENS AS THEY NODDED TO HIM WAS EVEN MORE PROOF THAT HAY SYSTEM WAS WORKING
8131-117016-0053 IT FITTED WITH THE DI OF PREDICTIONS OF SECURITY AND WITH THE SPYING GORDON WAS GOING TO DO ACCORDING TO THEM
8131-117016-0054 HE WAS GETTING EVEN FATTER NOW THAT HE WAS EATING BETTER FOOD FROM THE FAIR RESTAURANT AROUND THE CORNER
8131-117017-0001 IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN YEARS SINCE ANY HAD DARED RISK IT AFTER THE SUN WENT DOWN
8131-117016-0058 THE GROUPS GREW MORE EXPERIENCED AND MURDOCK WAS TRAINING A NEW SQUAD EVERY NIGHT

8131-117016-0059 IT WASN'T EXACTLY LEGAL BUT NOTHING WAS HERE
8131-117016-0055 COST A MORE BUT THEY'D BE RESPECTABLE

8188-274364-0000 THE COMMONS ALSO VOTED THAT THE NEW CREATED PEERS OUGHT TO HAVE NO VOICE IN THIS TRIAL BECAUSE THE ACCUSATION BEING AGREED TO WHILE THEY WERE COMMONERS THEIR CONSENT TO IT WAS IMPLIED WITH THAT OF ALL THE COMMONS OF ENGLAND
8188-274364-0007 HERVIIT THESE GENTLEMEN AT THE BAR SAY THEY SPEAK FOR THE CORNWEALTH AND THEY BELIEVE SO YET UNDER FAVOUR IT IS I WHO IN THIS PARTICULAR SPEAK FOR THE CORNALTH
8188-274364-0006 LET US NOT TO OUR OWNST DESTRUCTION AWAKE THOS SLEEPING LIONS BY RATTLING UPPER COMPANY OF OLD RECORDS WHICH HAVELA FOR SO MANY AGES BY THE WALL FORGOTTEN AND NEGLECTED
8188-274364-0009 YOUNG VAN FALLING UPON THIS PAPER OF NOTES DEEMED THE MATTER OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED AT TIP POEMH WHO NOW PRODUCED THE PAPER BEFORE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
8188-269290-0054 I MUST SEE HER MYSELF EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I AM QUITE SURE THAT NOTHING WILL SATISFY MISS LORDADALE EXCEPT A VERY AMPLE APOLOGY AND A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE REASON WHY SHE ABSENTED TO HERSELF
8188-274364-0005 IT IS NOW A FULL TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY YEARS SINCE TREASONS WERE DEFINED AND SO LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE ANY MAN WAS TOUCHED TO THIS EXTENT UPON THIS CRIME BEFORE MYSELF
8188-274364-0001 IN THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND HIS ADMINISTRATION HAD BEEN EQUALLY PROMOTIVE OF HIS MASTER'S INTEREST AND THAT OF THE SUBJECTS COMMITTED TO HIS CARE
8188-274364-0002 THE CASE OF LORD MONTORRI OF ALL THOSE WHICH WERE COLLECTED WITH SO MUCH INDUSTRY IS A MOST FLAGRANT AND THE LEAST EXCUSABLE
8188-274364-0003 THE COURT WHICH CONSISTED OF THE CHEAP OFFICIALS OF THE ARMY FOUND THE CRIME TO BE CAPLED AND CONDEMNED THAT NOBLEMAN TO LOSE HIS HEAD
8188-274364-0010 THE KING PROPOSES THIS DIFFICULTY BUT HOW CAN I UNDERTAKE OFFENSIVE WAR IF I HAVE NO MORE MONEY
8188-274364-0008 MY LORDS I HAVE NOW TROUBLED YOUR LORDSHIPS A GREAT DEAL LONGER THAN I SHOULD HAVE DONE
8188-269290-0053 I AM AFRAID I AM REPLIED LIZZIE DISTRESSED NOW IN HER TONE
8188-269290-0056 THE GIRL WHO BREAKS THE RULES HAVES TO BE PUNISHED
8188-274364-0004 WHERE THE TOKEN BY WHICH I SHALL DISCOVER IT
8188-269290-0055 EXCUSES MAKE NO DIFFERENCE
8188-269290-0057 I WILL TELL HER
8280-266249-0002 THERE WERE NO SAD LEAVE TAKINGS TO MAR THEIR PLEASURE THE CHILDREN WERE IN WILD SPIRITS AND ALL SEEMED CHEERFUL AND HAPPY AS THEY SAT OR STOOD UPON THE DECK WATCHING THE RECEDING SHORE AS THE VESSEL STEAMED OUT OF THE HARBOR
8280-266249-0003 AT LENGTH THE LAND HAD QUITE DISAPPEARED NOTHING COULD BE SEEN BUT THE SKY OVERHEAD AND A VAST EXPANSE OF WATER ALL ROUND AND THE PASSENGERS FOUND LEISURE TO TURN THEIR ATTENTION UPON EACH OTHER
8280-266249-0014 HE LED THE WAY THE OTHERS ALL FOLLOWING AND TAKING OUT A SLIP OF PAPER READ FROM IT IN A DISTINCT TONE LOUD ENOUGH TO BE HEARD BY THOSE ALL ABOUT HIM WITHOUT DISTURBING THE OTHER PASSENGERS
8280-266249-0000 OLD MISTER DINSMORE HAD ACCEPTED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM HIS GRANDDAUGHTER AND HER HUSBAND TO JOIN THE PARTY AND WITH THE ADDITION OF SERVANTS IT WAS A LARGE ONE
8280-266249-0001 AS THEY WERE IN NO HASTE AND THE CONFINEMENT OF A RAILROAD CAR WILL BE VERY IRKSOME TO THE YOUNGER CHILDREN IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO MAKE THE JOURNEY BY WATER
8188-274364-0011 YOUR MAJESTY HAVING TRIED THE AFFECTIONS OF YOUR PEOPLE YOU ABSOLVED AND LOOSE FROM ALL RULES OF GOVERNMENT AND MAY DO WHAT POWER WILL ADMIT
8280-266249-0011 I DO INDEED THE PROBABLY COMPARATIVELY FEW ARE AWARE THAT TOBACCO IS THE CAUSE OF THEIR AILMENTS
8280-266249-0006 YES SHE ANSWERED THAT LITTLE GROUP YONDER A YOUNG MINISTER AND HIS WIFE AND CHILD I SUPPOSE
8280-266249-0004 THERE ARE SOME NICE LOOKING PEOPLE ON BOARD REMARKED MISTER TRAVILLA IN AN UNDERTONE TO HIS WIFE
8280-266249-0007 AND WHAT A DEAR LITTLE FELLOW HE IS JUST ABOUT THE AGE OF OUR HERALD I SHOULD JUDGE
8280-266249-0013 WITH ALL MY HEART IF YOU WILL STEP INTO THE GENTLEMAN'S CABIN WHERE THERE IS A LIGHT
8280-266249-0012 DOUBTLESS THAT IS THE CASE REMARKED MISTER DINSMORE
8280-266249-0005 BESIDES OURSELVES ADDED COUSIN RANNALD LAUGHING
8280-266249-0008 DO YOU SON WAS THE SMILING REJOINDER
8280-266249-0009 HE CERTAINLY LOOKS LIKE A VERY NICE LITTLE BOY
8280-266249-0010 SUPPOSE YOU AND HE SHAKE HANDS FRANK
8280-266249-0016 THE HALF DOZEN CIGARS WHICH MOST SMOKERS USE A DAY CONTAIN SIX OR SEVEN GRAINS ENOUGH IF CONCENTRATED AND ABSORBED TO KILL THREE MEN AND A POUND OR TOBACCO ACCORDING TO ITS QUALITY CONTAINS FROM ONE QUARTER TO ONE AND A QUARTER OUNCES
8280-266249-0020 IN A SMALL COUNTRY TOWN SEVEN OF THESE MYSTERIOUS PROVIDENCES OCCURRED WITHIN THE CIRCUIT OF A MILE ALL DIRECTLY TRACEABLE TO TOBACCO AND ANY PHYSICIAN ON A FEW MOMENTS REFLECTION CAN MATCH THIS FACT BY HIS OWN OBSERVATION
8280-266249-0028 NO DOUBT NO DOUBT RETURNED MISTER LOWBURN BUT IF THY RIGHT EYE FIN THEE PLUCK IT UP AND CAST IT FROM THEE FOR IT IS PROFITABLE FOR THEE THAT ONE OF THY MEMBER SHOULD PERISH AND NOT THAT THY WHOLE BODY SHOULD BE CAST INTO HEALTH
8280-266249-0015 ONE DROP OF NICOTINE EXTRACTED TOBACCO PLACED ON THE TONGUE OF THE DOG WILL KILL HIM IN A MINUTE THE HUNDREDTH PART OF A GRAIN PRICKED UNDER THE SKIN OF A MAN'S ARM WILL PRODUCE NAUSEA AND FAINTING
8280-266249-0026 AND AGAIN I BESEECH YOU THEREFORE BRETHREN BY THE MERCIES OF GOD THAT YE PRESENT YOUR BODIES A LIVING SACRIFICE WHOLLY ACCEPTABLE UNTO GOD WHICH IS YOUR REASONABLE SERVICE
8280-266249-0023 NO SIR WHAT KNOW YE NOT THAT YOUR BODY IS THE TEMPLE OF THE HOLY GHOST WHICH IS IN YOU WHICH YE HAVE OF GOD AND YE ARE NOT YOUR OWN
8280-266249-0027 IT MUST REQUIRE A GOOD DEAL OF RESOLUTION FOR ONE WHO HAS BECOME FOND OF THE INDULGENCE TO GIVE IT UP REMARKED MISTER DALY
8280-266249-0018 THAT THE FRENCH POLYTECHNIKA INSTITUTE HAD TO PROHIBIT ITS ILL USE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS EFFECTS UPON THE MIND
8280-266249-0029 THERE WAS A PAUSE BROKEN BY YOUNG HORACE WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING A GROUP OF MEN GATHERED ABOUT A TABLE AT THE FURTHER END OF THE ROOM
8280-266249-0021 AND THEN SUCH POWERFUL ACIDTS PRODUCE INTENSE IRRITATION AND THIRST THIRST WHICH WATER DOES NOT QUENCH
8280-266249-0030 THEY'RE GAMBLING YONDER AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOUNG FELLOW IS BEING BADLY FLEECED BY THE MIDDLE AGED MAN OPPOSITE
8280-266249-0024 FOR YOU ARE BOUGHT WITH A PRICE THEREFORE GLORIFY GOD IN YOUR BODY AND IN YOUR SPIRIT WHICH ARE GODS
8280-266249-0025 WE CERTAINLY HAVE NO RIGHT TO INJURE OUR BODIES EITHER BY NEGLECT OR SELF INDULGENCE
8280-266249-0019 NOTICE THE MULTITUDE OF SUDDEN DEBTS AND SEE HOW MANY ARE SMOKERS AND CHEERS
8280-266249-0017 IS IT STRANGE THEN THAT SMOKERS AND CHEERS HAVE A THOUSAND AILMENTS
8280-266249-0022 HANDSOME RESORT TO CIDER AND BEER
8280-266249-0035 HIS VICTIM WHO HAD BEEN LOOKING ON DURING THE LITTLE SCENE AND LISTENING TO THE MYSTERIOUS VOICE IN SILENT WIDE EYED WONDER AND FEAR NOW ROSE HASTILY HIS FACE DEATHLY PALE WITH TREMBLING HANDS GATHERED UP THE MONEY HE HAD STAKED AND HURRYING TO HIS STATEROOM LOCKED HIMSELF IN
8280-266249-0034 NOW THE VOICE CAME FROM THE SKYLIGHT OVERHEAD APPARENTLY AND WITH A FIERCE IMPRECATION THE IRATE GAMESTER RUSHED UPON DECK AND RAN HITHER AND THITHER THERE IN SEARCH OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0042 A MAN OF GIANT SIZE AND HERCULEAN STRENGTH HAD LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE AND SLOWLY RISING TO HIS FEET SEIZED THE SCOUNDREL IN HIS POWERFUL GRASP
8280-266249-0046 MISTER LIBURNNE AND MISTER DALELY EACH HAD A DIFFERENT TIME SOUGHT OUT THE YOUNG MAN WORDS INTENDED VICTIM AND TRIED TO INFLUENCE AND FOR GOOD
8280-266249-0039 THAT FELLOW NICK WARD IS A NOTED BLACK LEGG AND RUFFIAN HAD HIS NOSE BROKEN IN A FIGHT AND IS SENSITIVE ON THE SUBJECT WAS CHEATING OF COURSE
8280-266249-0044 I THINKS NO I THINKS I DID YOU FROM MESIN RETURNED HIS CAPTOR NOT RELAXING HIS GRASP IN THE LEAST
8280-266249-0045 THE GERMAN RELEASED HIS PRISONER AND THE LATTER SLUNK AWAY WITH MUTTERED THREATS AND IMPRECATIONS UPON THE HEAD OF HIS TORMENTOR
8280-266249-0041 THEY HEARD HIM IN SILENCE WITH A COOL PHLEGMATIC INDIFFERENCE MOST EXASPERATING TO ONE IN HIS PRESENT MOOD
8280-266249-0038 I WONDER WHICH OF US IT IS REMARKED THE FIRST LOOKING HARD AT OUR PARTY I DON'T KNOW BUT COME

8280-266249-0031 THE EYES OF THE WHOLE PARTY WERE AT ONCE TURNED IN THAT DIRECTION
8280-266249-0033 AT THE DOOR WAS SLAMMED VIOLENTLY TOO
8280-266249-0036 WHAT DOES IT MEAN CRIED ONE

8280-266249-0060 OH HOW KIND HOW VERY KIND MISSUS DALE SAID WITH TEARS OF JOY AND GRATITUDE WE HAVE HARDLY KNOWN HOW WE SHOULD MEET THE MOST NECESSARY EXPENSES OF THIS TRIP BUT HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAST OUR CARE UPON THE LORD ASKING HIM TO PROVIDE
8280-266249-0051 THEY BEENN EAGERLY OVER THE BOARD EACH WATCHING WITH FEVERISH ANXIETY HIS COMPANION'S MOVEMENTS EACH CASTING NOW AND AGAIN A GLOING EYE UPON THE HEAP OF GOLD AND GREEN BACKS THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM AND AT TIMES HALF STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TO CLUTCH IT
8280-266249-0052 A DEEP GROAN STARTLED THEM AND THEY SPRANG TO THEIR FEET PALE AND TREMBLING WITH SUDDEN TERROR EACH HOLDING HIS BREATH AND STRAINING HIS EAR TO CATCH A REPETITION OF THE DREAD SOUND
8280-266249-0053 BUT ALL WAS SILENT AND AFTER A MOMENT OF ANXIOUS WAITING THEY SAT DOWN TO THEIR GAME AGAIN TRYING TO CONCEAL AND SHAKE OFF THEIR FEARS TO THE FORCED UNNATURAL LAUGH
8280-266249-0058 THE CAPTAIN COMING IN SHORTLY AFTER THE SUDDEN FLIGHT OF THE GAMBLERS TOOK CHARGE OF THE MONEY AND THE NEXT DAY RESTORED IT TO THE OWNERS
8280-266249-0050 AN INTENSE VOICELESS EXCITEMENT POSSESSED THE PLAYERS FOR THE GAME WAS A CLOSE ONE AND THE STAKES WERE VERY HEAVY
8280-266249-0059 TO ELSIE'S OBSERVANT EYES IT PRESENTLY BECAME EVIDENT THAT THE DAILIES WERE IN VERY STRAIGHTITEN CIRCUMSTANCES
8280-266249-0049 THEN MISTER LIWORTH WAKING FROM HIS FIRST SLEEP AND HIS STATEROOM NEAR BY THOUGHT HE WOULD BREAK IT UP ONCE MORE
8280-266249-0054 IT CAME FROM UNDER THE TABLE GASPED TOWARD LOOK WHAT'S THERE BUT YOURSELF
8280-266249-0047 YET THERE WAS GAMBLING AGAIN THE SECOND NIGHT BETWEEN WARD AND SEVERAL OTHERS OF HIS PROFESSIONS

8461-278226-0005 SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH PEARL GRAY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AZURE BUTTERFLIES
8461-278226-0006 HE WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRU IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
8461-278226-0002 ONE MORNING LAURA AUNT TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
8461-258277-0015 SO ALI RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT THAT PASSED FROM FIRST LAST AND THE CALIPH SAID I HAD NOT THOUGHT THAT THOU WOULDST KILL HIM FOR THAT HE WAS A SORCERER
